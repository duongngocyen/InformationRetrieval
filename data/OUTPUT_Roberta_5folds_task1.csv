ios,"ios has a lot less fragmentation and fewer devices. 

for android you have dozens of different devices running with different specs that can handle different things, these devices are then further fragmented by their android versions. the two newest version, nougat and oreo, are only used by about [37% of android users](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) compare that to apple where ios 10 or 11 is being used by [95% of users.](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/)

couple this with specs ranging from a potato with a screen to a high end flagship, and you need to figure out a good point to target. if you target too high you'll have a ton of people who won't be able to use your app, if you target too low you might end up missing on modern features and the app itself becomes worse overall.

on the other hand if you work with ios, you have a couple of devices to develop for, these devices come with a very similar hardware set with similar features. almost all of the users have access to the newest os version so you can confidently use all of the latest and newest features without the fear of your app not running on certain devices. it's just a much easier and simpler process than working out a good plan for the massive amount of android devices.

then there's the article someone linked which states that ios users buy more apps. so if you're going to make a paid app, you definitely want to focus on ios since it's the platform that's going to make you more money.",neutral,positive,positive,1

ios,"coming from somebody who just switched from android (lifetime user) to ios last year.
it‚Äôs a good switch 
imessage is great
i feel the keyboard is superior but that may just be personal preference.
icloud and icloud+ are nice and cheaper than google backup (if you are paying for storage)
i never have to worry about the amount of apps open, or left not-closed i see no adverse effects to the phone‚Äôs performance.
i am coming up on one year with an apple and the phone (13pro) seems to run as fast as it did day one.
the battery also still lasts easily through a day and a half of moderate to heavy use (for me).
apple cash is so convenient (like venmo but only through imessage)
not necessarily ios, but the apple credit card is nice as well - 0% financing on apple products, 2% cash back whenever you use tap to pay with the apple wallet, 1% cash back for every purchase with the card.

downsides:
have not been able to find a way to share images or files via bluetooth (to a computer for example. you can air drop to another apple device but only apple).

imessage and facetime is nice since everyone i know has ios. getting others to switch to another app for one person, most are like ‚Äúok sure whatever‚Äù.

but with all my android phones, (motorola droid x, motorola droid x2, lg g3, nexus 6, and nexus 6p) as long as it was stock rom, they were fine. just like any other device, a reboot helps but overall, no major issues. i remember wasting away half day on installing kali linux on nexus 6 and was messing around instead of just going out. 

went to the iphone 7 plus and it took a bit to get used to it but i stoped messing with my phone as much. and now i‚Äôm in the apple ecosystem, everything just works together. and there‚Äôs really no ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù android tablet which pretty much what i use my ipad pro a lot for when i‚Äôm traveling for work. i can do media edits, document markups, and so much more. 

i‚Äôm deep in the apple ecosystem where i wouldn‚Äôt be able to dig myself out. iphone 13 pro max, ipad pro m1 11‚Äù, airpod pro2, airpod max, apple watch ultra, apple card, and apple cloud drive. i can be on my tablet listen to music and my phone rings, i answer it and my airpod switches automatically. not sure if android has that but i‚Äôm assuming it does seamless switching. 

some other things that sold me was apple not releasing anything to authorities without a warrant which makes me feel a bit more secure but i‚Äôm sure a back door was probably done and just not publicly known about. 
locking down devices (for my own good) so i‚Äôm not wasting time customizing the phone with roms.

ios,"there‚Äôs one thing that android / google / samsung doesn‚Äôt have apple beat. it‚Äôs the ecosystem. apple has designed all of it‚Äôs hardware and software to work together across all of it‚Äôs products. the iphone might not be the best smartphone however you won‚Äôt find a smartphone with a better family of products such as the apple watch and ipad and mac etc. 

the optimization and continuity between the ipad, apple watch and ios doesn‚Äôt come near the cross apple product capabilities of android / google / samsung. yes samsung is the better smartphone but they don‚Äôt have accessory partnering devices and hardware like the iphone has. 

in other words people get asked ‚Äòwhat is your favorite apple product?‚Äô no one really asks what‚Äôs your favorite samsung or android product because everyone answers it‚Äôs the phone. samsung is really good and better than apple making smartphones but apple is more consistent about all of their products.

the overall experience is way better, in particular when you use also macos (copy on ios, paste on mac it's too good), but also integration with icloud works very well.

i'm missing only open source alternatives on fdroid and perhaps decent free apps, but overall no comparison. it feels less bloated than any customisation other than android vanilla, it's smooth, works out of the box, you feel limited but you can live with it.

‚Ä¢ the system is pretty locked down but i never dove into my file system on my s9 anyways. i never customized it so the lack of customization hasn‚Äôt bothered me too much on my 11.
‚Ä¢ imessage is something that some iphone users love and i can‚Äôt say i‚Äôm one of them. it‚Äôs convenient at times to see if the person you texted is in the process of writing back (the famous bubbles) and facetime is pretty cool but i don‚Äôt use it too often.


‚Ä¢ if you care about security and updates then this one is pretty big: your s9+ is receiving or has already received android 10. it will get some more security updates and that‚Äôs it. it has the capability of receiving android 11 and 12 but samsung cuts off software updates so quickly for their flagships and sometimes critical updates are delayed for months. with an iphone you get 5+ years of support if you want to keep a device that long (and some people definitely do. i see a ton of people using 6/6s). this was one of the big things with me. i just feel better knowing i paid $700 for a phone that will get years of support versus paying actually more ($1,000+ in some cases) and getting half the years of support. some of my wife‚Äôs family has the s8 and note 8 series of phones. they recently paid them off and their bill went down a lot. they don‚Äôt want to get 4 new phones in their family and start their bill higher again. but their phones are closing out on software updates soon. sorry for that rant but that was one reason why i left samsung. i‚Äôd consider returning if they kept their phones updated for longer. i‚Äôm one who likes to keep phones for a bit.",negative,positive,positive,1

ios,"things just work. got sick of ""app not responding"". you still get the odd crash here and there on ios but generally it is a lot more polished.

ecosystem. whilst its an expensive buy in, the apple ecosystem really does make for a nice user experience. there was a point where my phone would ring and at the same time my watch, macbook and two ipads would ring. the ability to answer a phone call or respond to a text on one of a number of your devices is great. means i dont have to pick my phone up if i need to respond to something if ive already got another device in my hands. there are some lockins of course which can get a bit annoying so i tend to use some google services just so i can access them easily through the web on my pc.

homekit. a bit of a niche one but ive got quite a few smart devices and homekit is by far my favourite platform for this. it isn't something i switched to ios for but it sure as hell is keeping me from leaving.

lifetime. apple devices in my opinion stay running at good performance for a lot longer than any androids i've used. the last android device i had brand new was a galaxy s8 and even though i didn't use it much, it still ended up getting very slow after a year or so.

updates. my first iphone was a 7 plus. its been 5 years still then and its still getting new ios versions and will probably get the next major ios release. android pales in comparison when it comes to updates, youre lucky to get 2 years with most manufacturers.

i know android has matured a lot and companies like samsung are starting to have an ecosystem like apple, but back when i switched noone was doing it better than apple and i still don't believe anyone is to be honest.",positive,positive,positive,1

i like the longevity in terms of support, resale value, and it just works so well out of the box. also the ecosystem; airpods pro, ipad pro, awu2 - they work flawlessly together.

the most niche reason why i‚Äôm still with apple is the nfc capability for suica/ic cards for japan travel/day to day living. i can easily charge it with my cc in the wallet and it works as a form of payment at most major retailers in addition to being my transit card. androids purchased outside of japan unfortunately do not have this ability.",positive,positive,positive,1

the ipad would get additional features over time (peer-to-peer airplay mirroring with the apple tv, apple pencil, split-screen, great apps), i enjoyed using ecosystem features like airdrop, continuity and the ability to share apps with my iphone. my 5k imac's screen is amazing for working on documents and spreadsheets, and it's served me well when i was conducting lessons from home.

ios,"**long story short:** was an android fanboy until i was challenge by a friend to give iphone a try. really liked it and made me stick with iphone after using android for since motorola razor (not the new one). now i got a lot of apple devices.

**long story:**  
first, i was an android fanboy. first smartphone was an android (technically motorola droid 1 which it wasn't activated used it like an ipod) motorola razor not the flip. i had a friend who'd used iphones because their family prefer iphone. i did try using ipod touch the 2nd last gen and i was so closed minded that i treated it like an android and gotten so angry with it because it wasn't android.

years later, i was needing a new phone to retire my galaxy s7 (i think) and challenge me to use an iphone. i bought an iphone 6s on ebay for $150 and decided to be open minded about it, act like i never used a smartphone. after using it i was shocked, the iphone 6s was older than my galaxy s7 but ran almost new and still gotten updates on it. my s8 was slowing down, and i've haven't seen updates on it for a long time. then i finally decided to get an iphone xs max to upgrade because how shock i was with iphone 6s. 

later on, i was getting bored of iphone and gotten really into privacy focus things. so, i bought google pixel 5a and install calyxos and tried nothing but privacy focus and open-source apps. later on, it gotten really annoying, so i reinstalled pixel rom and used the google ecosystem. not even a month the pixel phone was getting slow, and i had to factory reset my pixel couple times to make it feel faster like it used to. then i bought a galaxy flip4 because i was hopping back and forth between google and microsoft. then i bought a m2 mac mini and this where it all started.

i've always wanted to try macos because i've used windows, linux, and chromeos. so, i bought mac mini to give a try for 14 days and then return it if i don't like it. i really liked it reminds me of windows and linux. linux is my favorite os, but lack of software makes it a downside. then i grab my iphone xs max to give iphone and mac integration a try and again really good. so, i decided to switch sims from the flip to my xs max to fully try it and it was good.

iphone xs max was still fast like it was brand new, and the flip was starting to slow down just a little. so, i fully switched back to ios. now i'm in the apple ecosystem; apple music, apple watch, iphone, mac, ipad, apple pencil, airpods pro, apple card, and now new owner of homepod mini. my friends are on ios so it's easy for them to facetime than using a different video calling (some don't have facebook or snap and they don't want to install another app just to video chat) and i can finally send a high-quality picture or video without mms. 

now i'm on iphone 5 plus having to retire my iphone xs max after install ios 17. today my dad asked me if i like using iphone and i told him i do because it's easier, convenient, since i got a lot of apple devices everything just works, and lot of apps just work because they don't have to support multiple devices. my next phone will be another iphone whenever something major changes or whenever i see signs of this phone getting old (probably hopefully in 5-7 years).",positive,positive,positive,1

at first i missed proper customization. samsung has really neat themes you can apply, some for free, some for a small fee. and you can't place your apps on the screen wherever you want, but it has to be filled out from top to bottom. i didn't like that at first and used tricks like empty widgets to move apps down a row and stuff like that. but eventually i embraced the apple way i guess. and right now, i like it.  


i started to see what apple actually offers, and what it does, is superior to android in ways. the native apple apps are actually so powerful that i stopped using a lot of the google counterparts (except for mailing app, gmail is still superior to mail). if you're used to gesture navigation through your phone, you will learn how to navigate ios fast. if you're not, please don't get stuck on the three button navigation that android has, and ios doesn't. i personally think gesture navigation is faster and more intuitive than 3 button navigation.

that said, i go android every time for two reasons:

1. the os, i own an ipad and have used iphones in the past, but to use ios as a main daily driver just wouldn't work for me, it'd probably require more tweaking for me then my typical new android phone does these days because stock android/android skins are getting so light and smooth. only thing that i wish android had over ios is battery optimization, because goddamn android eats battery up.

2. the diverse market, when choosing an android phone, i'm able to choose from a myriad of oems and android skins, each with ""gimmicks"" and features that may spawn something totally new and great and different price ranges depending on what i want in my next phone, compared to ios which is confined to one line, from one oem, that's all created and owned by one company, and is the only way to access a certain ecosystem. that just really turns me off from ios.

honestly looking at even the 7 or 6s next to the s8 at a phone store just last night made me realize that the iphone is really not as bad as one may think. the 7 already brought about much better power management so pairing that with even a 2500 mah could be great, but preferably we would see at least a 3000 mah. the screens really are not bad either with the retina, but they could look incredible at a higher resolution. though if i had to pick between a screen upgrade and a better battery, i would choose the battery. and the bezels are just getting old. samsung has done a great job at chipping away at bezels lately, especially with the s8. not gonna lie though, i am not a fan of the curved screens. if apple were to do an s8-styled 'infinite display' (dell should really have trademarked that) but without the curves? i would be down for that.",positive,positive,positive,1

ios,"i recently went from a samsung galaxy s7 (exynos version) to an iphone se. here's my pov, if anyone cares.

while the exynos s7 is a battery champion, the se holds as well if not sometimes even better. i get no random standby battery drains, and i don't have to hunt for that one rogue app that's responsible.

the screen: the s7 has a gorgeous screen... but seriously, the se isn't that bad. being small i don't really care for the resolution difference (and i still believe that a 1080p on the regular s7 would have been a better choice). i don't care about vr (the gear vr was terrible for me because of the fixed ipd) and the older retina display works well for my sight. for me the smaller screen beats the higher resolution and deeper contrast.

camera: here's one of the most subjective aspects of the phone. personally i prefer how the iphone post-processes the photos. still both cameras are pretty good, fast and support raw.

the size: can anyone link me to a good (at least mid to high range) android phone with a size comparable to the se? all i can find are cheapish phones with a lot of corners cut. this is the main reason i jumped ship.

ios vs android: i love the simplicity in ios. i don't really care about having a custom homescreen or widgets or whatever (to each his own). i do find a lot of stupid design choices though, like the lack of notification grouping. still, the os choice is very subjective (and i know people who prefer windows phone...).

each user has its own necessities. some prefer a better selfie cam, other prefer better audio... whatever.
what the iphone offers right now for me is the best choice, but should there be an android phone ""better"" than the se, i would jump back without any problems. there's no logic nor reason for brand loyalty in mobile phones, accessories (mainly phone covers) are normally tied to a single device so there's no advantage in getting the same family of phones unless they are aesthetically the same.",neutral,positive,positive,1

ios,"if apple made some hardware changes, would you be tempted to switch? || i am expecting a lot of of downvotes for this post so hit me with your best shot :). i am growing weary of android. i have outgrown my tweaking days and i want a phone that works well out of the box and has a long update cycle. take note, i am only comparing flagships . i played with my sister's iphone 7 and realized that i could live with ios. it was the iphone's hardware that turned me off. 

-their obsession with thinness that made battery capacity small. 
the smaller iphone has 1900+ mah battery. in android, that capacity would be a joke of a phone but due to ios's optimizations, it can go toe to toe with the smaller android flagships. now imagine if apple made a small but thicker iphone to accommodate a large battery. 

screen  
apple is using ips lcd. if they switched to amoled, battery life would be better no question about it.

second, their a10 chip already blows every android chipset out of the water so i do not know why they stuck with hd and full hd resolution. the small phone should be full hd and the big phone should be quad hd.

huge chins
again a major turnoff but it might be killed in the future

selfie camera and microphone
for some reason, samsung's older s7 has a wider selfie camera than the newer iphone 7 and the mic sounds more muffled than on the galaxy s7. 

again, i'm asking if apple solved these shortcomings, would you be tempted to switch?

android manufacturers tend to throw every resource they have on hardware but if google/android is the problem itself then what would improve in the years that follow?  

sorry for the long post, i needed to bring this out because i am really dissatisfied with google's direction. their executives act like nerds who go all out with an invention but then get bored and move on to the next great thing. they have bad after sales support  and they also set a bad example of how long a device gets updates. if the pixel itself would only get two years of major software updates and a few more months of security updates, why would samsung or any other manufacturer do anything differently?



edit: i didn't realize this post would blow up so much! i've been reading through the comments. i think the majority sees no problem with apple's hardware. ios is the main gripe of android users and yes, i completely forgot about the shitty file management and notifications system of ios because i was just using a borrowed phone. i'll have to do more pros and cons comparison. i intend to wait it out with my trusty galaxy s7 for at least 2 more years. i hope a revolution comes by then.

ios,"i moved from android to ios with the launch of the iphone 14 pro, and it took me a few months to fully adapt. the notification system is worse, but it annoys me less than i expected. 

however, there are two areas where i just can't understand why they are left in their current state. i feel like for most of these details, apple just said ""done"" when they build these features years ago and never bothered to review if they needed improvements (while i can understand the control center or notification system are the product of conscious design decisions)

volume and notification control sucks:

* no volume in most games unless you disable the silent switch
* you can't lower the sound from apps or notifications without lowering the call+alarm volume, because it's somehow the same thing
* aside from the lack of something like android's notification channels, you can't have some apps notify you without vibrating (useful for group chats for example)

and so does the keyboard:

* no easy access for symbols (i know about the ""swipe from the symbols key"" trick, but i'm talking about the option of inserting symbols with a long press from one of the regular keys, like on almost every android keyboard... and the ipad one)
* no dot nor comma key
* no way to add a single word on demand to the dictionary...
* ...or worse, no way to remove a single word without resetting the whole keyboard: ***what the fuck?***
* the state of third party keyboards is horrible. partly because of ios limitations, partly because those limitations have removed many incentives for improving those 3rd party keyboards.",negative,negative,negative,1

ios,"a bit late to the party but as someone that's used android for many years and has recently tried using an iphone (13 pro), i can tell you that i appreciate android even more now. i don't care about extreme customization, i will happily use as many of the features that come out of the box with a new phone, as long as they work reliably. i rarely change a launcher, install custom icon packs or other additions that significantly tweak the phone's look&feel. so ios didn't seem too limiting at first. but once i started using it, i realized that unless you used apple's apps, you'll have a rough time. i thoroughly disliked the build-in keyboard and tried using 3rd party ones. none worked reliably, i would often see the build-in keyboard pop-up here and there, even though it was no longer set as the default keyboard. only siwftkey had a dedicated number row but i didn't enjoy the typing experience on it. i had a pretty bad typing experience on ios that i just could not get over. i had to do extra taps here and there just to access a special symbol whereas on android, everything was front and center no matter what keyboard you used. just a more pleasant and intuitive experience. text manipulation was also finicky on ios. notifications are atrocious on ios, they are not persisted on the lock screen, once you unlock the phone, they're gone. you have to open the notification center and look for them. they're also more difficult to interact with. here too, i much prefer how android does it. apple wallet stubbornly refuses to let you add loyalty cards by scanning a qr code, which i find odd. the settings app contains the settings for all the apps installed on your phone. who's idea was that? i get how in theory, it can be better, but in practice, it's far from it. rearranging the icons on the home screen is, once again, finicky. but thankfully, you only do that once or twice. one of my biggest annoyances was the inconsistent back navigation. some apps work with a swipe on the left edge, some do not. some have a back button in the top left, that has a tiny hit target, and if you're not precise, you'll not trigger it. apps don't necessarily seem more polished, maybe this was the case a few years ago but i think most of the apps have caught up and offer the same experience on both platforms. so i'm really not enjoying ios that much, and apple's mantra of ""it just works"" really is more like, ""it just works, if you have nerves of steel and like doing extra steps to get the basics done"".",negative,negative,negative,1

the absolutely need to start clustering all message notifications up top with priority over other random notifications and to allow persistent top-pinning of specific apps. android seems to be very intelligent about how it handles these notifications-your e-mail and message notifications get top priority over some random game or app harrassing you. but on ios you get a super long endless page of notifications and for some inexplicable reason you get them split up by day so if you missed a day of notifications it's a mess to clean up. they also honestly need to make it easier to swipe to dismiss these things. that hard swipe left requires a lot of care to pull off perfectly.

i just feel like i need to put 3x the effort into maintaining my notifications on ios than android. ios does so much stuff better-the keyboard is far more responsive, everything is smooth as butter, and the software support is excellent. but i honestly don't know how the notifications can still be this crappy. i switched back to ios figuring that ios 13 had fixed the notification system but it's still a jumbled mess compared to android.

instead i've had to just put all my messing apps in the bottom tray to avoid missing important messages and i've set all the notifications to permanent. feels absolutely ridiculous to have to use this as a workaround but it's just too easy to miss important messages otherwise on ios because if you depend on the notification tray you get such a cluttered mess.

i will probably buy an se for my mom anyways so everyone can be on ios together in my family, but i really do wish they would just clean up the notification center.",negative,negative,negative,1

ios,"i was an android user until the iphone 7 plus. never looked back since. i tried phones like the oneplus one, htc one m7/8, and nexus 6p. 

with the nexus 6p, and i tried rooting it + installing a bunch of different roms on it. this was all in efforts of fixing the poor battery life on my phone. i even set the display to 1080p! 

what made me ultimately switch was 2 reasons. 

1. battery life was simply atrocious despite my best efforts, i even exchanged it at bestbuy, where i bought it from. 

2. software parity and support. the pixel 1 came out with fancy new software like the google assistant, while the nexus had none of the new pixel features, despite being updated to the same android version. 

iphones have none of these issues. battery life has always been consistently decent, and i‚Äôve had the 7 plus, 11, and now the 13 mini. software parity is good. features that don‚Äôt make it to older phones are usually hardware related, like night mode, or useless stuff like memoji. not to mention that ios 16 supports phones as old as the iphone 8, and given how fast iphones are for their time, they hold up well even after 3-4 years. my parents are still using 4 year old xr‚Äôs, and they run ios 16 really well.

i find myself constantly frustrated at apple for making design decisions like removing the headphone jack because ""courage"", while leaving basic things, like the volume slider nonsense, or anything beyond wallpaper customization, completely nonexistent. i want them to act like the industry leader they so clearly think they are. 

so while i would consider an iphone like you described, i don't have to, because it's already in my hand, with the lg g6. i regularly get a day and a half of battery out of it, the sound is amazing, the camera quality is sharp, and can easily go head-to-head with apple or samsung. i can customize it well beyond anything that i could even dream, even on cydia, and that's even if the era of jailbreaking an iphone is a thing anymore. i haven't seen a public exploit in awhile now.

android,"going from the 3g you might like the fascinate - it will be a bit more zippy looking. 
it's all very well listing the things that android features but i'll try to give a couple of practical examples of why i'm sticking with android:

**widgets** - you have to see these in operation to appreciate why android users like them. as an example, i have a calendar and fancy widget on my homescreen. calendar shows the next three appointments in my diary. so i can see immediately what's coming up instead of checking the calendar app.
fancy widget has a big clock, weather and a battery meter. useful to have at a glance without opening apps. 
there are widgets for this immediate type of information for lots of apps - twitter, facebook, reddit. most of them are flexible in terms of where they can be placed and real-estate size.

**multi-tasking / status bar** - again, this is something that just *works* and is so obvious. 
lets say you're browsing reddit is fun and you receive a text. on ios you get a notification window popping up - you read and can reply etc but that kicks you out of the app and maybe you dont want to read the text right away. android has a status bar along the top of the screen that notifies you of the text - read it now or save for later. if you do read it right away, you can exit messages and carry on in your previous app where you left off.

**choice** - might not be relevant to some, but you have a bit of choice regarding carriers, physical size, keyboards etc.
in terms of software, there are choices too. you could consider this good or bad depending how much you like to tinker. 
for example, i have smart keyboard installed. for me, it's much better than the stock or ios keyboard. it looks neater and has auto-correct that learns words that i use alot. smart stuff. others prefer swype or 8pen or whatever comes installed - you have the choice. 

be warned though, the apps on android can look a bit homely, but they mostly work and i can replicate anything i wanted my iphone/ipod touch to do with my android.

ever since people have been trying to push this privacy ""concern"" that makes little sense. they rail about google selling data in sites and comment systems that say in their tos that they reserve the right to sell your data while being completely ignorant of google's business model. it makes no sense for them to make one time data sales when they can instead sell the service of matching ads to people showing the signals the advertiser is looking for.

the big thing for me is the hole-punch in the display as this is something that would really bother me and sony are one of the few phone makers left to have an uninterupted display. i also like the old school features the xperia maintains as well like expandable storage and a headphone jack.

the downside is a somewhat higher price, regular software updates and the strong software features that google has added to the pixel like magic eraser. i'm hoping that some of these features will become available in android 12 aosp or leak via custom apks (and the magic eraser already has for some phones).

one thing i'll miss from the oneplus is the slider switch to move between silent, vibrate and ring. it's a feature you don't realize how much you use until you have it, the sony has a hardware button for google assistant so i'm going to try to remap it to be a toggle for this.",negative,positive,negative,1

android,"rootless pixel launcher 2.0 - based on aosp 8.0.0 || edit 2023/06/23: reddit is dead. come join me on lemmy. guide: https://github.com/amirzaidi/lemmy

the rootless pixel launcher was a massive success [the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/6gn8f9/rootless_pixel_launcher_port/), and i promised to make a follow up when android 8 sources officially released. i have been working non-stop for the past few days getting everything working but the end result made it worth it. this time i did not fully stick to my ""don't fix what's not broken"" philosophy and went a bit further, adding some features which i thought would be nice to have. let's start with the feature list.

--------

**pixel launcher features added to launcher3**

- qsb with transparent rectangle, google pill and date/weather

- different colours of notification dots

- filter google wallpapers and voice search from the apps list

- use google wallpapers to select a wallpaper when available

- device profiles, margins, icon counts

- disabled partner customization like motorola's 4 columns

- google now feed on the left of the normal workspace

- google calendar app icon with the date

--------

**my additions on top of the basic pixel launcher ones**

- on popular request for the nougat version: pull down for notifications

- oreo theme backported to older os versions with pixel blue accent colour

- notification dots backported to marshmallow

- automatically prompts for notification access so you won't have to dig through settings menus

- fix android 8 checks so nexus devices can use all new features

- show icon shapes on android 8 without developer settings enabled

- pressing the date widget opens the default calendar app

- keyboard properly closes when returning to the home screen from any app

- symmetrical hotseat

- filter google now launcher from the apps list

- pinch to overview

- samsung secure folder compatibility

- backport of circle icons

from my previous post:

> the a-b tests and the microphone icon are not included, so what you see is what you get. there are no toggles for any of the features.

--------

**faq**

> help, i cannot install the app because of a corrupt package error, how do i fix this?

delete the official pixel launcher if you have it installed. you need android 5 or higher to install this and android 7.1 for the full feature-set.

> why does the launcher use the pixel launcher package name?

only the pixel launcher package is allowed to use the weather widget on the home screen

> why is the launcher a debug variant?

you need to have the app installed as a system app or it has to be a debug variant to use the google now page. the workaround that nova uses takes a lot of skill to pull off, and will also take a lot of time. so unless i want to make the rootless pixel launcher require root, there is no way around this at the moment.

> can you release it on the play store?

no, because the pixel launcher package name is not allowed. neither is a debug variant app.

> why are my app shortcuts not working?

they only work on android 7.1 and newer, and the app needs to be the default launcher. to set it as the default launcher, select ""always"" when pressing the home button and choosing launcher3.

> why are my notification dots not working?

they have been backported up until marshmallow. if you are running android 5.1 or older please consider getting a new phone or using a custom rom. if you are on marshmallow or newer give the app notification access and if they still are not working reboot your phone.

> how do i replace the date with the weather?

enable location and google location services, refresh the google now feed twice, then check again. make sure the weather card is on the google now feed.

> can you implement xyz feature?

if it is not in the pixel launcher or in aosp there is a very small chance it will get added. think of the translations that are necessary for one simple toggle - a lot of work. as a perfectionist i do not want to have half-baked features. check out lawnchair if you want to try bleeding-edge stuff and more customization.

> app suggestions?

i am against them, because they caused a lot of problems in the nougat version. if someone had an open source version for it i would definitely reconsider the feature.

> icon packs

no, this deviates too much from the stable launcher3 base.

> can i trust installing this random apk?

everything is open source, so start android studio and compile it yourself if you don't want to use my prebuilt version.

--------

#version 2.1 is out!

- backports: transparent hotseat, search apps layout, transparent qsbconnector

- automatically hide the google now feed page and google pill when the google app is disabled

**more faq**

> i only have on option in the settings menu

this is normal, only android 8 users can see the other options. notification dots are always enabled on android 6 & 7

> how do updates work for this app?

i did not want to bloat up the launcher with an auto-update script so you will have to manually check the releases page.

> i only get 4 columns of app icons

lower your dpi. if you are on android 5, you're out of luck.

> how do i change the wallpaper for the lockscreen through the launcher?

install the google wallpapers app from the play store. then you will be able to do that.

android,"it's a great tablet.

i pre-ordered the korean lte version off ebay to get a working phone app in an attempt to reduce to a single device.

around the house i primarily make calls using the speakerphone. outside the house, calls and notifications were handled using the combination of galaxy buds bluetooth headphones and a fossil gen 5 smartwatch.

most of the time i could accomplish the tasks i needed with it in the book case in tablet mode. during work hours, dex using an external touchscreen monitor, bluetooth keyboard, and wireless mouse worked great. rarely, when i needed a laptop, i propped it up with the book case and attached the pogo pin keyboard from the flawed keyboard case (with dex also.) tbh the 10"" screen was just too small for me.

this setup fell down for me because of the camera. i have no complaints about the tablet's camera hardware, but i found myself wishing for a camera in my pocket too often while on hikes when digging a tablet out of a backpack wasn't feasible.

before abandoning the tablet as my single device solution i tried pairing it with a palm phone (awful battery life plus couldn't use tablet lte to make calls -- also no longer single device), a sony dsc-qx10 bluetooth lens camera (just...no), and a gopro. the gopro worked the best, but was still no match for the convenience of a smartphone camera.

i'm now attempting a note 10+ as my single device. it seems to be better suited to the approach.

i use the same desktop setup when i need it.

i have a nexdock touch pre-ordered for use as a laptop.

i'm hopeful, but what i'd really prefer is dex on pc to work with a chromebook as i've also tried the pixelbook and pixel slate.

other than specialty items (like the tablet with working phone app and the lapdock) i've been very successful at obtaining the hardware i've used second-hand through sites like craigslist and ebay.

android,"long term galaxy tab s6 review: the best android tablet that is awfully underrated || last year, i was in the market for a new tablet. since i was already in the android/samsung ecosystem, and my girlfriend already has the ipad pro, i took the bullet and bought the galaxy tab s6. here is my in-depth review after using it for about 8 months:

# display

this is the highlight of this device. i will say it: the **galaxy tab s6 has the best looking \~10"" display you can get on any device today**. it's vivid, contrasty, bright, and has excellent viewing angles. the main advantage is the fact that it's a large version of the amoled panel used on samsung's flagship phones. i have the new macbook pro 13"", ipad pro and a galaxy s10 to compare, and i can't think of a better device to watch movies or play games than the tab s6. it doesn't have the 120hz refresh rate of the ipad pro, but for my use case of watching netflix, reading ebooks, and playing some popular games (cod mobile, pubg, asphalt), all of which fall under 60fps, this 60hz amoled display wins over a 120hz lcd display. for more latency-sensitive use like drawing, and playing certain games, then the ipad pro has an advantage. worth mentioning that the tab s7 that's right around the corner, will likely have 120hz support as well.

# speaker

the tab s6 comes with a quad-speaker set up. it's loud, clear, and balanced. it's better than my (gf's) ipad pro (2019) and almost as good as my macbook pro 13 speaker (which is regarded as having one of the best speakers for a laptop). listening to music, watching movies or gaming is quite enjoyable on these. the speaker also seems to change its audio profile/direction depending on your screen rotation dynamically.

# design

the design is premium and sturdy. the design on the tab s6 is as good as it can get for a modern tablet. i do wish they had an ip rating, but that's something the ipad pro also lacks. the s-pen sticks to the back of the tablet. at first, i thought this was weird, especially if you are going to lay down your tablet flat. however, pretty much any case which would flatten the bump and makes it look like the s-pen is in a tiny hidden pocket. i think some even might prefer this over the ipad pro approach (which adds extra width).

# battery

the battery lasts all day of continuous usage. standby time has been pretty good for me as well, even after leaving it on standby for some days. overall, i have no complaints in this department.

# performance

this is one of the smoothest/fastest devices i've used, even after 8 months. the old days of samsung's laggy software are long gone. the tab s6 handles everything you throw at it with a breeze. games, multi-tasking, and just general usage are lag-free and fast. it comes with the latest ufs 3.0 storage which is an upgrade over the ufs 2.1 on the s10. one ui 2 update even brought some nice animations changes. 

# software

you would think samsung would slap on their one ui that's on their phones and be done with it, but samsung did add small but noticeable tablet-specific optimizations and features here and there. the s-pen and samsung dex integration are well done. you can use samsung dex straight from your tablet without having to use a second monitor, which is pretty cool. i also really like the new gesture system on one ui 2.1. i no longer have to reach all the way to the bottom just to go back. overall, i like the software. the system layouts are pretty intuitive and optimized for a tablet. speaking of layouts...

# app scaling

i've been pretty surprised by how well android apps work on devices with varying screen sizes. i can't think of any app where i thought the layout was bothering me. i guess if android apps work well on chromeos, foldables, and samsung dex, they should work fine on a tablet.

some google apps like youtube, many samsung apps like samsung internet and my files have some tablet optimizations. by tablet optimizations, i mean letting you see a bit more content at once. i think they are a nice touch, but i don't think they are an absolute necessity on android since android already handles app scaling pretty well.

apps without tablet optimizations work way better than they do on an ipad. instagram, for example, has massive letterboxing on an ipad. [whereas on an android, it's full screen.](https://mobile.twitter.com/daniel_scuteri/status/1265102390782382080) some might argue android is just ""enlarging"" the app, but i would say most people would prefer that over a miniature version of the app. plus, most android apps make use of the larger screen real estate by displaying more content (for example, more songs on spotify and more emails at once on tab s6 vs. s20).

# s-pen

these are just bigger versions of the s-pen on the note series, which are pretty good. compared to the ipad pro, the latency could be better, but that's more of a display refresh rate issue.

the biggest problem is the lack of apps that make use of the pen. some apps like dropbox paper have excellent ipad pencil support but no android pen support. i've found samsung notes to be the best at note-taking when it comes to the s-pen support. hopefully, more widespread adoption of the galaxy note/fold 2 series will help drive more s-pen support in apps.

# main gripes

* slow updates. i got the android 10 one ui 2 update a month ago, may 2020. that's pretty late to the party. some parts of the world got it months earlier but the us got it last. the one ui 2 on s10 was released late nov 2019, which makes you wonder why it took so long. security updates are also slow. i get security updates every three months, but my s10 gets them monthly? i am not sure why there's a vast discrepancy in update speed between samsung's devices. likely the issue is a mix of long qa testing, limited resources, and carriers taking their time.
* fingerprint scanner. in the past, the fp scanner had 60% success rate. nowadays, on the newer version of the software, i think it's pretty good at a \~85% success rate. still could be better, but these optical fp scanners are surprisingly more accurate to wet, sweaty fingers than the old capacitive fp scanners.
* camera. it's acceptable. it's a single 12mp camera that is not as good as the s10's camera. i've tried gcam ports on it, and they do seem to improve picture quality. tablets have always had weaker cameras than phones, and this is not an exception.
* poor thermal management when charging. if i'm playing a graphically intensive game while charging, the frame-rate drops 10 minutes in. my s10 does not do this, even though they have the same soc, and the tablet has a larger surface area for heat dissipation. i guess that the tab s6 lacks the liquid cooling of the s10 and/or the system doesn't correctly slow its charging speed under load.

# final thoughts

the tab s6 is a surprisingly good premium android tablet that does many things right. every time i use this device, i can't help but think it deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. a lot of popular tech reviewers seem to overlook this tablet entirely. the tab s6 is without a doubt an expensive tablet, but if you are someone who is strictly looking for the best android tablet, or the best 10"" entertainment device, i think this tablet should be #1 on your list.

**method 01:**

* link to download apk is here [v0.5](https://wwa.lanzouj.com/ix13jkyi9ub), link is in chinese: here's a [screenshot of the english translation](https://i.imgur.com/jdmk7tp.png)

* after downloading and installing, select this option shown in the image [here](https://i.imgur.com/bmdoyd6.jpg)

* this will open the preferred engine settings, select the engine shown in the image [here](https://i.imgur.com/betugwq.jpg)

* change the language by clicking this [setting](https://i.imgur.com/k90gghn.png)

* input this code block to change the language into en-us-christopherneural:

&#8203;

    <speak version=""1.0"" xml:lang=""en-us""><voice name=""en-us-christopherneural""><prosody rate=""${(rate-100)?c}%"" pitch=""${(pitch-100)?c}%""><mstts:express-as style=""serious"">${text}</mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>

&#x200b;


* use an epub reader with tts feature (like google play books), then open tts feature and enjoy!

* if you want to change it to a different language/voice, try out other voices [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#features) and then get the id of the name in [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=stt-tts).

   * e.g. i tried and want to use the voice package, monica (neural) in english (united states)

   * i will look for the id of monica (neural) [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=stt-tts)

   * the language is ""en-us"", and the id is ""en-us-monicaneural"".

   * i will now substitute these two information to the code block below.

&#8203;

    <speak version=""1.0"" xml:lang=""language here""><voice name=""id here""><prosody rate=""${(rate-100)?c}%"" pitch=""${(pitch-100)?c}%""><mstts:express-as style=""serious"">${text}</mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>

which will make it:

    <speak version=""1.0"" xml:lang=""en-us""><voice name=""en-us-monicaneural""><prosody rate=""${(rate-100)?c}%"" pitch=""${(pitch-100)?c}%""><mstts:express-as style=""serious"">${text}</mstts:express-as></prosody></voice></speak>

if the tts is too slow for you, you can change it in android settings > accessiblity > text-to-speech > speech rate. or maybe your epub reader has a built-in speech rate and pitch setting (like moon reader+).

[found a chinese thread which is the origin of the app](https://www.52pojie.cn/thread-1346893-1-1.html)

**why use microsoft azure's tts?**

* it's much better and sounds more natural than the default tts engine (google tts)
* has a variety of voices which you can choose from based on your preferences.

**why use tts at all?**

* if you love reading books, this tts engine is so good that it's practically turns all your books into a decent audiobooks. official audiobook are still better but the voices sound natural enough that it gets the job done.

---

edit: 

i found out **android's microsoft edge** also has this feature, it has less voices but it's still has a variety of good ones.
**method 02: using android's microsoft edge**

* just open your novel in microsoft edge (maybe via royal road, wuxiaworld, google play books, etc.), 

* open the options (three dots in bottom middle of the screen)

* then click read aloud. 

* you can choose from a variety of voices by clicking voice options on the top right.

  * (e.g. microsoft christopher online (natural) - english (us), which is my favourite voice among the ones available).

---

edit: i saw that the system-wide tts isn't working for some of you, here's an alternative i found.

**method 03: system wide tts engine using tts server app**

* download the zip file: tts-server_0.2_202212312219 in this [github link](https://github.com/jing332/tts-server-android/actions/runs/3812485613) (note: you have to login to your github account for link to work)

* extract the zip file

* install the apk

* the app is in broken english so it's a bit easier to navigate.

* click the ""+"" on the top right

* change the language in to your desired choice (e.g. english us)

* choose your chosen voice

  * you can get a preview of the voice by putting words in the preview form and then hit play.

* exit out of the app and go to android settings

* search for text to speech or go to system > language & keyboard > text-to-speech output (it will vary 
on your phone but this is the general idea).

* change the engine to tts server

* use an epub reader with tts feature (like google play books), then open tts feature and enjoy!

* **too slow?** try this: hamburger menu (top right) > settings > turn on user dns to resolve api ip

---
**""this is a lot of work, is there an easier way?""**

well you can change the voice of the default tts engine on your phone (mostly google tts or samsung tts). i noticed that the default voice is bad, but some of the other voices is a slight upgrade.

**method 04: adjusting google speech services/samsung tts engine**

* go to android settings

* search for text to speech or go to system > language & keyboard > text-to-speech output (it will vary 
on your phone but this is the general idea).

* click on the setting icon near the tts engine

* find install voice data

* find your language of choice (english us, english uk, etc.)

* download/choose among the various voices in there

* go back and then you can preview the voice. you can also change the speed and pitch of the voice.

* use an epub reader with tts feature (like google play books), then open tts feature and enjoy!

bonus: if you're using google play books for book reading and using google tts, you can go to google play books setting and turn on ""high quality voice"" (idk how much of a difference this makes but it should be better).

---

**method 05: another tts app**

* download the tts apk in this [github link](https://github.com/ag2s20150909/tts)
* install the tts 
* in your android settings, find text-to-speech settings.
* change engine from the previously installed text-to-speech to this new one.
* use an epub reader with tts feature (like google play books), then open tts feature and enjoy!

* if you want to change the default voice (jenny+) to another, 
  * open the installed tts (it's in chinese so it's a bit hard to navigate).
  * next click this to enable customization.
  * double click the name of your choice to choose and hear an example of said voice (i.e. christopher, sonia, etc.)
  * there are other settings in there, here's a link to an album of screenshots and their corresponding translation.

in contrast, samsung (who were virtually nonexistent in the world of android when htc was on top for the first 18 months following the g1) did very well in that time frame. they released fantastic products like the s2 and galaxy note. this was the period where android growth was atmospheric and samsung benefitted the most. they were praised by the android elite, those of us whose recommendations shape the purchases of our friends and family. at one stage, at least 10 people in my immediate circle had samsung android phones, many of whom used to have htc, including myself. 

however, this tide has turned, there's a consensus that samsung has become too big, and less dev-friendly. amongst the average consumers you won't notice, but amongst the elites and android proselytizers you're seeing samsung lose prominence right now. some of it is returning to htc because credit where it's due, the one is fantastic. but lg stepped up their game also (at least 6 people in my close circle now have nexus 4 or 5, i'd happily recommend the g2 also), as did motorola (the moto g is the only sub ¬£150 android phone i recommend to anyone right now).

android,"i've got the telstra version of the one x (the one xl), basically the at&t version, with a different radio and 32gb of storage.

so far so good. i don't see what the big deal with the screen is though. everyone's raving about it, like it's the best thing every, but to be honest it's no better (or worse!) than the screen on my lg optimus 2x.

here's some of my pros and cons.

pro

* 4g lte. this network is fast.
* great android speed. probably a combination of the processor and os here.
* camera is fast as well. unfortunately you can't disable the shutter sound on the telstra version, which becomes annoying after about 20 seconds.
* 32gb of storage is enough for me (for now). i only had an 8gb sd card in my old phone, i could never justify the price of the 32gb ones.

con

* screen is far too big. this is ridiculous. i'm 6'5"", and my hands are in proportion to the rest of my body, so as yo can imagine, reasonably large. i can't use this phone with 1 hand. i can't reach the settings button in the top right of the screen when holding it in my left hand. this is just stupid. you can also see just how much juice this screen uses. i have it constantly set to the lowest brightness, and at the end of the day the screen has used 70% of the battery.

* non-removable battery. pretty well covered issue here. i'd have much preferred a thicker phone with a bigger and/or removable battery. it doesn't need to be as thin as it is (though it also shouldn't be as wide and tall as it is!).

* no more ""menu"" key. i know this is more of an android/google thing, but it's just a waste to have a menu key take up part of the screen in every application. i know developers are supposed to be moving towards the menu button being up the top like in the google apps, but this is just a bad move.",positive,neutral,positive,1

android,"this isn't exactly a ""problem"" perse. 

before oreo, there was no way to say you weren't working outside the srgb colorspace. some developers want it on, some don't. now, with oreo, unless an app requests more than srgb colorspace, the app doesn't get it.

it's in the manifest now. if you want your app to display with more colors, set

> `android:colormode=""widecolorgamut""`

in the androidmanifest.xml (""hdr"" is also an option). if you don't set it, it uses a default setting of srgb.

google's mistake is not allowing users to create a system-wide default for applications that don't specify a colorspace. it's srgb.

the reason is that increasing the colorspace would increase memory usage and gpu processing:

>hen wide color gamut mode is enabled, the activity's window uses more memory and gpu processing for screen composition. before enabling wide color gamut mode, you should carefully consider if the activity truly benefits from it. for example, an activity that displays photos in fullscreen is a good candidate for wide color gamut mode, but an activity that shows small thumbnails is not.

but, the second problem is not even google chrome supports wide color gamut on oreo, so it's not like they were ready to go with oreo either, when it comes to their apps:

https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=735658

if you want to see how chrome doesn't support wide color gamut, check out how you can't see the webkit logo here:

you can't win either way. they'll be a software update (either 8.0.1 or 8.1.0) coming in the next week or so which will likely add back colour profiles for the display, ""vivid colours"" will likely be bumped from the apparent 10% to 20 or 25% or there will just be an additional more saturated ""vivid-er colours"" added.

i have a pixel 2 xl on android 10. it really wants me to update, but i haven't because i've heard there are some issues with android 11, and with eol coming up, those issues probably just won't be fixed. i'm fine with missing out on the update to not risk dealing with those issues.

another thing that makes me pause at the idea of updates is that newer versions have increased requirements. it probably doesn't matter much in many cases, but it can be something to consider, especially in phones that get many updates, already had bulky software, or have lower specs. i know the iphone 4s was notorious for this, i think the galaxy note had similar issues going from 2.x to 4.x.

the radio station takes a while to start. i assume this is because it's putting together the playlist. i say this because at first i thought it was just buffering the stream, but even after the ""starting station"" popup went away, the song still took a few extra seconds to buffer. it would be nice if the playlist was made in the background as the first song played, so that i'm not waiting for the first song to start.

the variety of the station is sometimes too broad, but sometimes too narrow. i can't really come up with a good way to fix this, and it's probably just me being picky, so i probably shouldn't complain.

for stations that are created based on song, you always have to hear that song first. i assume the same is true for stations created by artists or albums. granted, you can skip the first song if you don't feel like hearing it, but it would be nice to be able to create stations based on genre, or at least have the station randomized the next time you choose it.",neutral,neutral,neutral,0

i love to fiddle with my phone, hack it, tweak it, change the look and feel of it.  ios permitted this to some extent if you jailbrok it... until your phone would stop booting for some reason then you *had* to plug it into itunes and 'upgrade' it to the latest firmware, effectively breaking all your awesome customisations.

with android... even if it's not rooted with a custom rom you can do a whole slew of things to change the look and feel.  once you do get root... you can do pretty much anything you want.  definitely more than what you can on a jailbroken iphone.

*itunes*: seriously... i wouldn't be caught dead using this as even a secondary media player.  if i even felt like using the shitty audio quality of my iphone 3g (vs my cowon devices.. with good sound and equalizers..) i would be forced to buy a mac or windows (assuming i don't pirate it...) because my main media os is linux-based.  with android? oh that's no problem buddy! we'll just act like your cowon... a filesystem that can be mounted and written to w/o garbage bullshit like the apple crap.",negative,negative,negative,1

now that's a fucking disappointment. at first i thought it was fast and beautiful. well, beautiful it is. but it sometimes freezes, takes some time to launch and, worst of all, has problems with font rendering. really. for instance, check out reddit.com in the desktop version. some submissions are regular size, sime are gigantic. wtf? i've see it on other sites too. and also, it pisses me off that i have to tick the ""desktop mode"" toggle each time, why can't it remeber it? it's a goddamn tablet, sites make sens in desktop mode!

it really baffles me, how could google fuck this one up? it's the most vital app on the otherwise awesome tablet,and their flagship program at the same time.

up until a few weeks ago i was using a gsiii.  

pros: 
- ran smoothly despite my constant use and abuse
- fit perfectly in my hand (i have really small hands)
- never received any serious physical damage despite being dropped a lot. 
- removable battery

cons:
- battery was really unpredictable. sometimes i could use it all day with no issue, others it was dead within hours with similar usage. swapping the battery didn't change a thing.
- in order to get the phone to charge, i'd have to try wiggling in the charger at weird angles. eventually, it just didn't charge anymore. 
- touchwiz and bloatware. i found touchwiz became more bearable after switching to nova launcher, and i was able to disable most of the samsung and rogers crap. but that damned s voice was so annoying...
- sometimes it would start playing music out of nowhere, including in the middle of the night and while sitting in my bag during class

when i initially sent in the phone i was told it would take 2-3 business days. then when 3 business days came it got pushed to 3-5 business days and well you get the picture.

it has now been 26 days since they've had possession of my phone and not a single person at samsung can explain to me why i have no received a refund or whether i am even getting a refund. all the managers i've escalated the situation to have told me ""i'm sorry, there's nothing i can do, you just have to wait.""

samsung does not care about its customers, all they want is to get their phones back and not refund you for them. 

i am not alone, on the note 7 subreddit and xda-developers no one has received a refund yet either.

i want to get the word out there to let everyone know how samsung is treating its loyal customers. please never buy samsung again. people deserve better.

edit: the most frustrating part is how samsung has no answers. every representative or supervisor i've spoken to the last 3 times has told me they don't know why i haven't received my refund and they have no way of investigating and finding out why. i've worked in customer service before and it boggles my mind that they think it is acceptable to just tell a customer ""i don't know."" and that's the end of it.

edit2: there is a thread on the android central forums with plenty of people in the same situation as me. no one has received their refund or answers. http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7-returns/726774-second-hand-note-7-recall-thread.html

edit3: i see a lot of people telling me to do a charge back. that would just screw over the original person who sold the phone to me, not swappa. the note 7 is being recalled for safety concerns, so whether i bought it from samsung, swappa, or a man in a parking lot, they are responsible for it. they are the ones pushing every user out there to return their note 7s as soon as possible, so they have to take responsibility for making things right.

if you bought a used car from someone and the car exploded while you were driving (due to a manufacturers defect) are you going to hold the person who sold it to you responsible? or the manufacturer of the car?

spotify is better:
-social. this doesn't compare. i really enjoy the ability to subscribe to my fb friends' playlists, send music to them, etc.

-podcasts. so didn't confuse my downloaded podcasts for music and show on the app. google does. 


google music is better:
-library management. the ability to add a song, album, etc to ""my library"" is excellent. spotify is poor in creating a library beyond playlists, so google music delivers an experience more like itunes, which i prefer. 

-android app. it's just better imo

-integration with music already uploaded

ultimately i was very bummed to see a few apps i use multiple times a day unavailable on android...so even though i loved the phone, i went with an iphone 8+ and am currently being held hostage by ios. the iphone x i won't even consider because it's absolute trash in my opinion, so hopefully the 8+ will hold me over until the x2 or whatever the hell comes out. just keeping my fingers crossed that ios 12 is cool; because i've stopped enjoying ios altogether, and no phone will fix that.",negative,negative,negative,1

and the most important point, they pulled a red herring on us. sd cards being slower than ufs, but that's not the point. having a card slot does not decrease speed in any way. the choice, will you used the sd card slot or not, is one we no longer have.

oh well, it ironically helped me save bucks though as i no longer bother with premium phones due to lack of card slot now.",negative,negative,negative,1
android,"in high school (when the smartphone trend really started) i didn't care much beyond the price and being able to run games.
when i finally learned some development, it seemed so easy to do all kinds of stuff with android phones, whereas a friend that wanted to do ios apps had to jump through hoops installing virtual machines to run macos and get literally anything working on iphone, even music, whereas i just used bluetooth, sd cards or usb drag and drop. 
at that point i was used to being able to do so much with my phone that iphone felt like a downgrade in every aspect, while still being pricy (i never cared for the expensive flaghips, most i ever spent on phone was like 450‚Ç¨)",positive,negative,positive,1

android,"i own both ipad 2 and sgsii.
i have to say, ipad is a hell of toy. vast amount of  libraries of gaming and music, drawing is quite amazing. alien blue do wonders in redditing too. 

however, that's it. when it comes to laptop replacement, ipad is quite not an option. its lacking of native filesystem access is the most annoyance. it simply destroys proper office-related cross-application works. and guess what, none of ios browsers support downloading/uploading. well it downloads documents, but it won't allow me to view it in a document viewing/editing application. browser simply web-views it.

its keyboard is quite annoying either. most of its features are good enough, but why it shouldn't have any arrow keys? it's not even an option. 

overall ui of ios is not physical keyboard/mouse friendly. you cannot browse through items of a list using arrow keys of physical keyboards. it may seem to be nit-picky, but i found it quite annoying.

of course jailbreaking allows most of these complaints, but it is chunky and buggy as fuck like using wm6 or palm in 90s. not unusable, but not that sleek either.

that said, android is simply more powerful. android tablets may not be able to be a excellent toy as ipad is, but at least i won't feel like to be treated like a child.",neutral,negative,neutral,1

android,">if you think apple doesn't do the same thing then i have some bad news for you...

&#x200b;

uh what? apple absolutely doesn't do the same thing. google has data on literally everything you do, apple doesn't even care. the difference between google and apple is that i can choose not to install apps that steal my data (fucking ironic, ""be together, not the same"" my ass) on ios, on android, even if i buy a pixel, i'm getting my data taken the second i power on the device and log into my google account.

&#x200b;

the delusion level to try justifying google's insane disregard for privacy is mind boggling. ""oh, this other company does it, so of course it's fine."" yes, every company is after your money, the difference here is that one cares about selling hardware, and the other profiting off of your data. it's time to stop deflecting the blame. just because a different company profits off of your data, it doesn't mean google doing it is okay.

it's about time that company got a hard looking at. anybody that thinks these things are okay is a moron in my eyes. we have some more corporate koolaid on that table over there.
