Android,chase314,6079,"A few reasons for me, but I think the primary one is freedom of choice.  I've used Android, Windows Phone and iOS over the years, and I just keep coming back to Android.   There is no denying that iPhones are high quality and are perfectly fine for most consumers - they have nearly unparalleled 3rd party accessories and honestly iOS frequently gets prioritized over Android for app updates.

What iOS cant' match Android on is freedom of choice, and being able to choose a phone that has the features you care about.  Bored with the way your phone looks? Throw a new launcher on it. Are you an avid photographer and want a camera phone that lets you get really granular with your settings? Android has you covered.  Want to use a different music/messaging/map or essentially ANY other app than the default one that came installed? Go for it! That doesn't even cover the custom ROMS (aka operating systems) based on Android that are available out there.

It also goes beyond the Software choice but absolutely into hardware too -  Flip phones, folding phones, phones with styluses, phones that still have a headphone jack, phones with finger print sensors (great to have during a pandemic when iOS Face Unlock wouldn't work with a mask...unless you upgraded/bought one of their newest phones), Android phones come in all shapes and sizes, and often at a lower price than a comparable iPhone alternative too (though that's not always the case nowadays).

Cutting edge features also come to Android first (if any of those matter to you).

Android is basically a customizer's dream, if you want it to be, but the important thing is you have the option to choose.",118,positive,"Main object: Android

Android,kvenaik696969,8075,"Couple of reasons:

1) Behaves relatively close to a ""computer"". Some of the behaviours are very closely linked to how I'd use a MacBook (for example). The file explorer behaviour, layout, etc are ""the same"". Sideload works similarly. Tweakability is similar. I haven't had a need to root newer phones, but with root, it's basically the same. The one time I needed to check a job running on our Linux cluster, I downloaded juiceSSH and was done. I am also able to use whatever app I want to do whatever I want - I can have 50 different browser or clock or file explorer apps. 

2) Notification presentation isn't borked and ""weird"". From the old days of the scrolling ticker to what we have now - notifications have been a generally consistent, clear, very useable experience. Chronological ""text-style"" delivery (i.e., queue vs. stack) of notifications is probably the best thing Android does. The android notification system and experience (the notification shade) is probably one of my favorite user design pieces. Very usable. This has imo, changed and grown organically over time. Apple's implementation feels like it has been slapped on. However, the big issue with Android is the disconnect that Google's E-Mail notifies earlier and more consistently on Apple devices, compared to Google's own OS. If you haven't used Android notifications, I implore you to give them a try.

Android,stereomanic,2032,"Ok, let me begin with my history with Apple, a little bit. back then, i was always curious about Apple but it was always an arm's reach away from getting one and it seems only ""creatives"" were using them. Graphic design, motion graphics, you named it, they had it. what puzzled me was that Windows had the same thing. So i got the iPod Touch and i saw it was better than the Palm Pilot or whatever it was called back then especially in terms of smoothness. Not too long after that, the whole jailbreak thing came along and made my iPod even more interesting. 

somewhere along the way, i lost my iPod and it got stolen and worse still, it took me so long to save up for it . I'm not American and at the time, buying one of these things is like saving up for a custom PC in my country. well, almost. 

I wanted to get the new iPhone but it was just too expensive and i missed the Apple podcast stuff as i would listen to it on my iPod and such. I saw the iPhone as an iPod with call function enabled. I never like that i needed to use the stupid iTunes to transfer my music files. 

So the first ""smart"" phone i could buy was the android , which at the time, felt like a jailbroken iPhoneOS (i think that was what it was called at the time) but a bit janky here and there. However, it was what i could afford but I love that i could just plug to my PC and transfer files. 

Android has improved by leaps and bounds, and iOS has matured , i dare say. Still, i tried using the iPhone and it felt very limited despite the power of their hardware. macOS to me is the most useful software that Apple has created whereas iOS, and sadly iPadOS to me, is meh. 

However, that's my use case, not everyone's use case. 

I don't like Apple one bit but ironically, i work in a company that is super Apple products only but i'm fine, they pay me well to use it haha. I even said i didn't like Apple in my interview but i know how to use it. I just refuse an iPhone. 

I like how samsung has improved but i really hated the touch-wiz. ugly and feel demonstrably useless at times. However, One UI is a joy to use, but even if you hate it, there's always other launchers to choose from. I love that i have a choice. 

The only thing i feel is dangerous about Android, is if a user isn't too careful with what they install since we can install from any source. FOSS is amazing though. i love that they have that. it's not only customising for me. it's almost like , if you can think it, it probably already exists on android. whereby, on Apple, we have the tools, we just don't let you use it but subscribe to our cultish ways anyway. 

I don't hate apple users btw. i just dislike their fanboys a lot. they make linux fanbeards seem like smitten kittens. btw, i love linux , the better macOS haha. ok, that's just me being bias, take that with a pinch of salt. 

on my android , whether you root or not these days, there are ways to deter ads, there are ways to use free hotspot (idk if your country gives free hotspots). there are ways to run linux on it (not amazingly well if not rooted but hey, it's there). on iPad , you can semi tether and run [UTM.app](https://UTM.app) for VMs but they're not as amazing as i thought it would be. 

i love the desktop mode of android tablets and generally samsung dex mode, similar to huawei, LG (RIP), motorola (closest to dex) and you can actually do work. While iPhone now is USB-C and fanboys are like, wow, look , we can mirror on the screen. I was like, dude, Android had that since before. 

I do say, I like that iPads have more desktop level pro apps, which is sadly not as much on the android side albeit, there are. like lumafusion is on android now. 

I like that essentially, if you jump from iPhone to android, the pain is not really there unless you're really stuck with iMessage which for me, thankfully, i am not. we use whatsapp mostly for personal and for my work, slack. slack desktop is better on the iPad than it is on the android but you can run that on a browser. 

If you do jump to Android, try Kiwi Browser, it's open-source. it allows you to use chrome extensions albeit, not all of the extensions will work amazingly i think but hell, i wish google has that on their mobile chrome. give me a desktop tier web browser please. that alone will make it way easier on android or whatever. also, iPadOS, please have macOS desktop mode. wishful thinking but oh well. 

anyway, TLDR, i love that android is versatile and there are many cool things that you can do on it that might be niche,but it exists and there is more than just one source to get things done, which is good to me. customization aside, it's those things that got me on android longer.",5,neutral,"Main object: Apple (iOS)

Connectivity: I can connect my Android phone to any smart screen with screen share/mirroring, or connect with a cable to a PC and transfer files/documents freely. With an iPhone, that is not the case.

NFC: Android allows 3rd party apps to use NFC which is something I use quite often from topping up my travel card to making mobile payments.

Battery: Charging up an Android is much faster than an iPhone, and it comes in handy on hectic days. Even with a mere 45W fast charge, my Android phone fills up a lot faster than my iPhone. It is a piece of mind knowing that i can get a good amount of juice in just 30 mins. 

Intuitiveness: I find the UI/UX of Android much more intuitive from its universal back gesture to easy access to app settings to notification management. It took me a while to get used to it, but using them side by side now, iPhone seems to have lots of arbitrary inconveniences compared to Android.

New ringtone? Just put the file on the phone. App that's not in the app store? Just put the file on the phone. I also find the customisation better, and the logic of the OS is better for me. I can't find anything on an iPhone, I find it really clunky and badly designed. All my co-workers have an iPhone, though, and they can't find anything on my Android. It used to be the case that you paid through the nose to get an iPhone, and that landed you an objectively worse phone with a bad OS and decent battery life. Apple caught up though, and now it's mostly down to personal preference and legacy. iPhones take great pictures and the battery life seems better than Samsung for instance. For me, I can't get used to iOS and I need the file compatibility/drag and drop, so that's why I stick with Android.

long story: i never liked Apple products. was never a fan of Steve Jobs. i am a very technical person (electric/computer engineer), so Apple's and Jobs's BS did not resonate with me. and so, after Nokia and a few Windows Mobile, I stuck with Android. that, and the fact that i did not grow up in the US. iPhones, and Apple products, for me, were all overpriced. it was too ""limited"", yet overpriced. it was all about the apple logo.

over the years, almost everyone in my family started using iPhones (USA). as the ""technical"" person, i had to help them with their issues... and younger me was always just frustrated by how ""stupid"" some things are in Apple devices. even in the early iPod era before iPhones were a thing, iTunes was... abysmal. every new product is behind the competitor.

fast forward today. i use an iPhone (in addition to Androids). only because it now uses USB-C. and i cannot believe i am still NOT able to set custom notification per app (every app, not just Apple apps).

I had a couple iPods in high school as well, but by that point the tinkering bug had bit me *hard* - RockBox was something that I had installed on my iPod, and I had obtained a cheap Optiplex GX1 workstation from my high school and maxed it out. A few years after graduation, Android was introduced on the T-Mobile G1 (HTC Dream), and my buddy had purchased one. I was hooked. 

Got my first real android device a couple years later in the form of a Barnes and Noble ""Nook Color"", which ran a modified version of gingerbread. Rooted and modified that, then took over my ex-wife's HTC my touch 4G, and it was all downhill from there. Got a Nexus 4 and really dug into the ROM and rooting community. Took a short hiatus because financial shit, then came right back: Nexus 6P -> Pixel 1XL -> OnePlus 6 -> Pixel 6 -> Pixel 7 Pro

Root that doesn't require weird workarounds every time you reboot, tasker, launchers, a real filesystem, KB/mouse support, and so much more keeps me interested.

* Apple's fallen behind on UI/UX in many areas. E.g. nearly everything in Android is visually reactive, where on iOS you're often guessing whether you actually tapped on something correctly because it's completely static. I also prefer the clear solid colors and bolder contrast vs translucency/blur.

* Consistent back gesture is a big one. On iOS it's all over the place, with the worst offender being the tiny text label that's almost unreachable in the upper left.

* Customizable homescreen. I don't even need anything fancy, I just want to keep my icons near the bottom of the screen where they're easier to reach and in the same place, and I hate it when companies change their icons to something stupid.

* File management is still easier on Android. iOS has come a long way but Files' UI is clunky compared to Solid Explorer, also there's still this weird isolation between Files and Photos on iOS.

Android,TurboFool,2453,"My choice goes back to the literal beginning. I was used to Windows Mobile when the iPhone came out, and I was excited for the iPhone for about 10 minutes. But the first one was massively lacking in major features I took for granted, making it a non-starter for a crazy high price (for the time). 

And while they slowly improved it, the walled garden around Apple was just too high. I was used to devices and operating systems where I could install the apps I wanted, do the things I wanted the way I wanted to, and yes, customize them in some very basic ways Apple refused. Heck, in those days the iPhone refused to support copy and paste, as they were confident they could do a better job predicting what you might want to do with things like a phone number or an address that you'd never need it.

When Android came around, and it was clear Windows Phone was dying, it was the obvious alternative. Unlike Apple who dictated how you used their phone, Android allowed me to use my phone the way I wanted. Steve Jobs even proudly proclaimed that if you wanted porn on your phone, you should buy an Android. And while porn was not REMOTELY a deciding factor in my choice of OS, it was absolutely symbolic of the divide: Apple could and would dictate the morality of their device, and the competition would not. And so I never bought an iPhone.

With time Android became more and more innovative and clever, and Apple got more and more good at waiting 3-5 years to implement an Android feature in a way they got massive praise for. So I got things sooner, although maybe less polished, with more freedom and flexibility. And some things have never caught up, like notifications.

It was also all the proprietary hardware, like non-standard cables and accessories, that kept me off too. A lot of that has improved with time as well, with USB-C being the most recent example, and I'm glad to see that happen. But we got that 8 years ago and never looked back.

And the rest is familiarity. Thanks to having always used Android, I know it, and I like it better. I'm in IT and have to support iPhones all the time, and I don't like it. Is that because mine's better? Probably not. But mine is familiar and easy for me, and that's enough reason not to switch now.

I'm happy the iPhone exists, because Android absolutely wouldn't be what it is without it. And I'm happy iPhone users are happy with it. But Android has been my home since version 1.5, and that's unlikely to change soon.",1,negative,"Main object: iPhone and Android

Things I like on Android more:

Notification Center

    I like having an easy VPN toggle there that doesn’t open nordVPN

    I like how replying to messages from the notification better

    The toggles are better in there

Background processes

    Substantial uploads to proton drive, mega, etc not happening in the background 

Keyboard

    I do not like Apples keyboard for managing multiple languages. Placing the cursor in text is more annoying even with the long press on spacebar

App settings organization. I do not like the iOS settings app

split tunneling in nordVPN

Browsers with extensions

Browser YouTube 720p

    Firefox with uBlock origin is amazing to me

Per app volume control. This exists on Samsung and maybe other Android skins

Game console emulators

Native GeForce Now and GamePass streaming apps


App icon arranging. App drawer. 

Clear cache/data on an app

F Droid, side loading apps

More open source apps in general

     Revanced

     newpipe

     Aegis Auth

     It was nice downloading in development Switch emulators to test to side load

Swipe gesture back off left and right edges

I prefer faster UI animations

I prefer transferring many files by cable. It’s a much better experience on Android

I have ended up using more google apps over time on my iPhone. Went Apple Maps back to google maps. I only use the iPhone Photos app for basic viewing, management I relegate to wherever I back up to. iCloud I use only for phone backups and use Google Drive mostly now. Though I have an old Mega account back when it was 50GB free that I use too. 

I don’t like the iPhone notes app, I reverted to Keep for what I want backed up. On Android I used Joplin for non backed up notes. I really dont like Safari. iOS Brave is an improvement on Safari but I’d rather Brave or Firefox on Android. I don’t use Chrome

iOS default calculator sucks. I bought a calculator app. There’s SuperImage, a free AI photo upscaler on Android that I play with occasionally, didn’t like the iOS alternatives. Most of them wanted subscriptions to remove ads whereas SuperImage was a one time payment 

A few times I’ve wanted a little utility to do something and I’ve had easier times to find free and open source ones on Android compared to iOS

iPhone battery life is great though and the phone backup and restore works really well

1) RIchness and variety in the ecosystem. There’s a couple dozen OEMs who design and manufacture Android phones, and they are in constant competition with one another to innovate and iterate. It’s really fascinating to see the breath of options. 

2) Customization of the home screen: iOS has gotten so much better at this in the past few years, but Android is still superior. Specially with 3rd party launchers, grid size, configuration, icon shape, size and appearance can be altered at whim. I’m very particular as to how I use and organize my homescreen. I also like to go into developer settings and increase the Minimum Width to be as high as the device will let me (500 on my s23 Ultra)That way on screen elements are rendered as small as possible to maximize use of screen real state. 1440p phones have such insane PPI that I want to take advantage of that. Icon size in iOS, even in the ‘small’ setting is still cartoonishly big.

3) Ability to sideload apps and use 3rd party stores / app distros. Pretty self explanatory. Specially for stuff like emulators. I love my iPad with an M1, but it pains me that I feel constrained by all the stuff that I can’t run on it. 

4) Probably the most important of all: the ability to install and run an actual web browser that is not just reskined Safari. I use certain websites at work that simply don’t work well with Webkit. 

I think iPhones are cool, but I’m happy Android exists. Also Ithere’s the added bonus that people don’t really use iMessage in my country so you don’t miss out on that if you use Android.",1,positive,"Main object: Android

I remember reading this article at work one day, not having been particularly convinced by smartphones that they were yet useful enough for me to spend an extra $30/month. I had been following the iphone news closely, but it was just an apple product on at&t, an exciting development in technology but otherwise not quite useful to me.  


When I read that review, it finally clicked. Smartphones were destined to become fully functioning computers that fit in our pocket, and this was essentially the first one that pulled all those essential ingredients together into a modern design. Open source OS, hard keyboard, file system, wifi, full browser, mp3 player w/ 3.5mm jack, GPS, USB, hi-res display. I didn't know much about Android (or Symbian for that matter) at the time but that soon changed. Android was about 4% of the marketshare when the OG (and Android 2.0) launched.

I started having problems with it and by May of 2011 the battery life was so bad I had to buy an external battery pack, the vibrate switch was broken from normal use, and it was suddenly becoming very slow with each major update. I still had faith that Apple would release a spectacular new iPhone so I decided to hold off on my upgrade thinking I would regret immediately buying an iPhone 4. I waited and read the daily rumors and from the rumors I was pretty excited. When I saw the 4S announcement I was incredibly disappointed and thought that was the shittiest excuse for a ""new"" product. I thought that even if I get a 4S I'll be shafted every 2 years by getting an ""S"" line of iPhone rather than a whole new device. I immediately started looking into other options and bought the Galaxy SII on AT&T since it was most like the international version and seemed like a nice transition.

I recall really falling in love with a phone, the Sony J5, such an amazing phone for its time, it had everything, a nice side rocker plus that sand and monkey game. 
I still wish I had it now, for nostalgic reasons. 


My first real smart phone was the Ericsson p1, I was happy with it, but I swore that would be my last phone from them , as all my Ericsson phones all died due to software errors. 
When that died I needed a new smartphone,black berry was a no go for me, (never liked them) so i waited and waited for the pre to wrap up and end in my hands, when I saw the finished product I was fairly disappointed and knew it would be a failure at get go. 
Figured i could try out the Android, then saw this really good deal, the zte blade, was a good starter and now here I am with the GN.

Android,themcp,17862,"There were four major factors that contributed to my ditching iphone, not all of which are still relevant.

* I got *really* sick of Apple telling me what software I am allowed to run on the device I paid a lot of money for. Just because Apple doesn't like it doesn't mean I don't, and I was watching developers have their apps removed from the app store for implementing nice features that Apple didn't feel like allowing. Even that wouldn't bother me - Apple does own the app store after all - except that there are no alternatives. You have to buy your apps from the app store, unless you jailbreak your device, in which case Apple continually tries to fuck with your jailbreaking with their updates. I should not have to be at war with the device manufacturer to be able to use the software I want.

* My iphone never had acceptable ring volume, and eventually the speakers died altogether - it didn't ring at all. I took it in and Apple refused to honor my state's consumer laws which require them to give me my choice of repair, replacement, or refund, until I threatened a lawsuit and pointed out that no judge or jury would side with Apple in claiming that an iphone shouldn't be required to last as long as the contract you have to pay to buy it, at which time they said something to the effect of ""it's impossible, totally against policy, can't be done, there's no mechanism for issuing a replacement to you, utterly unthinkable, no way it can ever happen, and if you'll just sign here please we'll give you a replacement phone right now."" So all the time they spent telling me there was *no possible way* and I could *never* get a replacement phone under the circumstances because it *can't be done* was a lie that evaporated very quickly when I said ""lawsuit"". I was rather offended.

* My less-than-two-year-old iphone had become un-usably slow. I mean I'd touch the screen and I could go get a cup of coffee while I wait for it to respond to me. This slowdown wasn't gradual, it happened in big chunks... every time Apple put out an OS update, my phone got dramatically slower. But choosing not to upgrade was not an option really because the day the new OS is released, a whole lot of apps abruptly require it to purchase or get an upgrade... so if you don't upgrade, your phone is instantly obsolete. So, I felt that Apple was railroading me into a more or less forced upgrade process that made my phone get unusably slow, and their only response when I took it to the Genius Bar to complain was to tell me to buy a new iphone. I'm suspicious that this may be intentional to make you buy new Apple hardware regularly.

* At the time, the only carrier option for iphone was AT&T. The minimum reasonable service plan was $110 or so a month including fees, and the service... flat out didn't work. It was pretty bad when I got it, but AT&T promised improvements. It got worse. Soon I was paying $110 a month for cell phone service that worked only in the subway. I'm not kidding: it didn't work in my home, in my office, walking around my neighborhood, in the city (Boston)... but I had fantastic service riding around in the subway. Well, sorry, but I bought a phone so I could use it in places I want to spend time, not underground where I don't expect to be reachable anyway. And yes, I complained and complained and complained to AT&T, and they repeatedly told me ""oh, I see we're having some problems with the cell in your neighborhood, and someone is working on it now."" Bull. So, between the large price tag and the total lack of service, I was pretty desperate to get away from AT&T.^1

So, when my AT&T contract finally expired, I bought a $10 flip phone from Virgin and tried it out and discovered that they have great service in the areas I care about. I therefore bought a cheap Android phone from them for $150, and signed up for a $25/month plan - a savings of about $85/month versus having AT&T. I wasn't sure if I'd like Android, I'd never used it or even really seen it, but I figured if I used the thing for only 2 months it'd pay for itself and since there was no contract I could switch to any carrier I want, and it'd give me time to decide what I want and shop around.

I liked Android a lot more than I expected to (I figured it would be like a craptastic version of iOS), and while that phone was a bit on the wimpy side in terms of processor and storage, it was still enormously better than the damned iphone. So I gave that phone to some poor friends (who are still happily using it) and bought myself a nicer one.

How it has worked out relative to my four original complaints:

* Android doesn't dictate what you're allowed to run. Not only is Google much more liberal about what they allow on their app market, but you can just go into settings and turn off the restriction of only installing from the google store, and install whatever you want. So, it's 100% what I wanted in that regard.

* Of course it's not having the same hardware problems as the iphone did. I have had some problems. But, I dealt with them in a normal manner and things worked out fine.

* A decent Android phone from two years ago can be just fine today, and Android 2.2 and above can all get plenty of great apps that are compatible, so the whole forced upgrade thing is not an issue with Android at all. Again, that's 100% what I want in that regard.

* Obviously, I got away from AT&T, so that's also 100% what I want in that regard.

For me, switching to Android has been a huge win. I'm very happy with the system and have three Android devices I use daily - a phone, a 7"" tablet I take with me, and a 10"" tablet I leave at home. They're convenient and highly useful.

They sent me to collection, and their collection agency phoned me 3 to 6 times a day until I blocked their number.

Firstly, storage. The iPhone itself is expensive and the price will increase as the storage goes up but with Android, I can make do with the base model as I can just load up a 128GB micro SD card in there and up my storage. 

Second, customization. iPhones are stuck to their home screens which are very cluttered but Androids have an app bar where all your apps are situated which honestly makes the home screen much cleaner and you can put your most used apps only. 

Lastly, price. Sure the iPhone is praised for the camera but it's so expensive that it's not worth it in my opinion.

I gotta admit. Android is way more open in customization and app installments. You can tweak it to your favour and even overclock, underclock your CPU and GPU.

For the record, I had a Galaxy Note 2 for around 4 years from release, had even Android 6.0 installed via LineageOS (was Cyanogenmod back then) and it run just smoothly, like the day I got it. Never had something to complain. Except one day, I dropped it and my screen shattered into 1000 pieces. RIP.
After that I got myself a Redmi Note 3 (Qualcomm) and this thing flew. But I only had it for around 4 months, when I crashed into a pole while skateboarding and the whole phone bent. I still have it and it still works, but the screen is cracked, the phone is bent and the display is showing wrong colours sometimes. After this dilemma I bought a Redmi Note 4 (Qualcomm) for just 120€. After I got it, I flashed LineageOS Oreo on it, and oh boy, another world of difference to the Redmi Note 3.
I used the Note 4 for a few months with the Google Camera HDR+ mod installed and it was fine for my usage. Battery had enough backup for easy use of 2 days. 

But then I saw a deal for a iPhone 7 Plus for 350$ and I just had to buy it.
I gotta admit, that iOS is just much more optimized and its awesome.
Sadly youre restricted in customization and the notification system, oh boy. In comparison to Android its a mess.
But other than that, its a new life. Sadly I dont have that much time anymore to customize my Android, so I'm kinda glad, that I'm  restricted somehow. Like alot of people say, iOS just works.

Android,jmnugent,3344,"I have both a Pixel XL 2.. and an iPhone X (I do mobile-support and MDM/DeviceManagement for a living)

On the Android side,.. I like:

* I've had several Android phones over the years (Motorola, Samsung, HTC, etc).. but with the Pixel 1 and 2.. I think the biggest thing I enjoy is that it's just straight up vanilla Android. No bloatware. No 3rd party vendor crapware. No nothing but just nice, clean, pure Android. I definitely appreciate the simplicity of that.  

* I also enjoy getting Security/OS updates consistently and on-time. As an IT guy who has an eye for NetSec/InfoSec.. It's nice to see Security taken with the seriousness it deserves. 

However there are a few things I really still don't like about Android. It feels far to ""utilitarian"" to me. It's nice that it's functional.. but the way that functionality manifests itself into hoardes/layers of settings/choices,etc.. just (to me) ends up feeling a lot of unnecessary complexity. I don't tend to use my Android phone like the typical Android geek who wants to tweak/hack/root/customize/theme,etc. I don't have any interest in any of that. I just want something simple that works. There are some little annoyances --- like tapping in a Browser and getting that little zoom-bubble thing. I hate that shit and there's apparently no way to turn it off. 

On the iOS side... the things I like:

* the uniformity/rigidity/narrowness of the entire ecosystem. Some people see that as a negative.. but I like the clarity of it. I know exactly what I'm getting. And it's limited scope means it's simple and consistent and predictable and intuitive. App design especially.. is consistent with the overall OS. Where an Android phone feels like a ""functional tool"".. and iOS device feels more like a ""object of art"". I'm totally fine with that. The lack of options and relative simplicity of iOS.. seems to help me get more done faster. I don't feel like I'm fighting the device. 

I think iOS gets a poor stereotype for being limited.. when it's not as true or extreme as the stereotype would want you to believe. There's a lot of things iOS can do (such as plugging in a USB keyboard or USB Ethernet adapter) that most people think it cannot do (but it absolutely can). So I think people are a bit to narrow/closed-minded. (they approach iOS with their mind already made up of what it's limitations are -- instead of approaching it with an attitude of ""lets see what it can do?!"".. ) 

Generally when someone come to me with a mobile-device question.. I pick up both my Pixel 2 and my iPhone X.. and i figure out how to solve the problem on each platform. The 2 platforms may take different routes/paths to get to the goal.. but in most cases I can get to the goal on both. Then it just comes down to preferences.",5,positive,"1. Main object: Android

Basically support was long over, and unlike on Android, on iOS Apps stop supporting your dropped device quite instantly, not after several years like it's starting to happen with KitKat now.

Lo and behold, the iPod was stolen a few weeks in and me being 14 and needing a phone I needed an upgrade, I saved up for a while and the only option was going with a €180 Motorola Moto G2. I'd also been looking at Android for some time, tired of the slowness from my former, unsupported Apple device and frustrated from the OS closedness. Thinking back, I realized the Apple ecosystem hadn't been smooth sailing as advertised - so I went on a YouTube and tech websites and magazines binge to figure out what to do and not to do (I was about to get a cheap Samsung phone that released at the same time is still running 4.4.4, thankfully I did my research.) and decided for the 2014 Moto G. I'd researched so much I already went point blank on the play store - WhatsApp, Instagram, Spotify, Twilight, Nova Launcher, and (sigh.) Clean Master.

Still using the phone! It hasn't aged perfectly but what the hell, it's €170 and I know people who replace **flagship** phones faster than that.

Android,exelero88,6217,"Apple chips and Android chips aren't comparable at all. On the one side, Android chips are chips that could be applied in any device. Apple's chips are only applicable for Apple phones and they're only compatible to work with iOS. 

The second difference is the weight they have to pull: iOS is very lightweight, because it doesn't have to compile components that an Android does. You're comparing a GO-cart engine to a general car engine. All the comparisons are actual media stunts made to get nothing but attention and toss out content on the page or video plattform. 

Speaking of which, if you toss an SD 835 in an iPhone it'll run just fine, but throw an a11 in a Note 8 or a Pixel 2 and soon enough you'll be seeing the a11 not being the best chip ever. 

It's not common knowledge, it's common misunderstanding. 

Why Android manufacturers use Snapdragon chips and not one of their owns? Well, it's because Android is based on the Open Handset Alliance, which agrees to use open standards in their phones, which is why you see a Snapdragon, Exynos or MediaTek SoC used in a variety of phones (Meizu I think has rights to use Exynos chips). 

Therefore we can conclude that Apple chips are only fast and efficient because they only have 1 way to apply them and that's iOS. Speaking of a general chip strength, it doesn't even come close to a Snapdragon or an Exynos because these chips are widely applicable and would show similar performance in different varieties. 

And, even more so, the same iOS that's making the a11 appear fast is limiting the power of the chip, because you can't utilize the power in an everyday multitasking scenario like you can with multi window and split screen on an Android.

Eh. Yes and no. There is certainly some truth to this, but not to the extend that some people believe.

Apple was the inventor (1986) and major ongoing contributor to IEEE 1394 (Firewire). Their all-in support for USB with the original Blue iMac was a bold move that helped transform USB into the peripheral standard of the next 20+ years. More recently they were an early contributor and supporter of USB C. Now they are not only adopting Qi as a wireless standard but actively working on a new multi-device implementation of the tech that they have already stated they will contribute to the standard as soon as it is complete. 

On the software side, WebKit comes to mind. An open-source web rendering engine, it was introduced by Apple in 2003 and impacted the development of web browsing in ways that are hard to understate. ~95% of internet traffic at the time was rendered on the Microsoft’s proprietary Trident/Tasman engines (used in IE). 

WebKit changed that landscape and was central to Google’s ability to bring Chrome to market in 2008. Its usage in the original iPhone helped show the world that mobile internet browsing did have to suck. (Symbian browser anyone?). And their open source contributions hardly end with WebKit. Darwin, Swift, and Research Kit are all good examples. 

TL;DR: Yes, Apple has certainly had their fair share of proprietary implementations, but they have also been major contributors to standards and open source projects that have helped shaped modern tech.",1,positive,"Main object: Apple

This has never been done before and as such it's hypothetical. Do you have sources for all the hypothetical things happening around? If you had, they wouldn't be hypothetical. 

You have sources based of which you can build your hypotheses around. 

The source for my hypothesis above is that you have one company on one side manufacturing a chip for them with all the licences for the standards in mobile telecommunications (CDMA) while being able to choose what power goes best with their OS on one side (Apple), and 

A chip manufacturer making chips to be applicable in various things, where the OS has to apply to the chip (let's take Qualcomm for that example). 

This was thought impossible with the Macs vs PCs until apple jumped on the x86 train so it's possible to better make Hackintosh computers.

My opinion is that I paid upwards of $1000 for a phone. This isn’t the 90s or early 2000s anymore and I expect updates. Security updates, feature updates, security updates, all of it. This is a computer and thus needs updates. 

As far as performance issues over time that definitely happens with Android too. The biggest examples are Pixel and Galaxy phones. They were notorious for starting out quick and responsive but slowing down after a few months or years. Samsung and Google have addressed these issues but I don’t know whether they’re fixed or not. 

Rooting and flashing custom ROMs is more niche now than it has ever been. Unlike the early days of Android there are so many things you can lose by rooting or installing a custom ROM that it makes it difficult to justify unless you’re an enthusiast. And that’s assuming of course that your phone even has a root exploit or enough popularity to have a decent and stable ROM. Again, unlike in the old days this is a niche market and even people who were formerly all about tinkering aren’t willing to deal with a “totally stable” ROM that can’t make calls, connect to any Bluetooth devices and needs to be charged two times a day.

But if you really did use your first android phone ever I wonder how that would go. Most apps are updating regularly and closely with the OS they are designed to work well on. I mean to say that it is not just OS features like animations and such, but features of all of your apps, notifications, integration, how they talk to each other. 

An old phone won't not work... but it also won't just look older, everything on it will probably not be able to do something a more recent version of the OS made possible, will use more resources than it was using when it was designed to run on your phone's OS... security updates are a thing but also so are warantees.

Android,Mosess92,6328,"10 years ago updates mattered alot. Lots of new features, fixes and huge improvements came with every major(sometimes even minor) update. For example the jump from Donut to Froyo easily doubled the software's performance and added an app store. Gingerbread to Icecream Sandwich had a complete UI remake, and then Jellybean introduced stutter free and smooth animations system wide.

Both Android and iOS were still young(for lack of a better word) platforms that would see major improvements over the years. Back then if you had an iOS device you would automatically get the update and you can enjoy the new features as soon as it's released. With Android its a different story, only a couple of flagship devices would get the latest update, sometimes 6 months late. Other devices were basically out of luck(unless you tinkered with custom ROMs, which an average user wouldnt do). It was a really messy situation.

I believe thats the reason why people cared alot about Android updates and how quickly a certain device model can get them.

Your working on a conceptual level, they are working on a input/output level. For you, the UI changing is interesting but you still see it as a layer above the actual operation of the phone to perform a task. For a normal person, they are using the UI to perform a task.

So for example you get an update which changes the phone settings app icon to something different, gives it a new name, and completely re-organizes the way the settings are arranged within the app. You still understand that there is a settings menu and that it contains the settings you want to change but this exists independently of the settings app as an abstract model of how your phone works, so you just need to find something which looks like it might be what you are looking for, then quickly update the model of how the app relates to the settings on your phone you want to change. But if you are a non-technically gifted person, the thing you are trying to find now looks different, it's called something different, and when you do find it you can't be sure if this is the right thing because it nothing is where you remember it being. To use this updated settings app, you now have to relearn all the required inputs you need to make to get the desired output which takes longer.",27,negative,"Main object: Phone settings app

2) I perceived this phone to have a bit of staying power: Decently spec'd, removable battery and SD support, as well as many of the parts being screwed in as opposed to glued or soldered lends itself to better repair-ability. One exception is a cracked screen requires replacing the whole display as opposed to just the glass, which is a $60-70 component. It's still an easy fix and gives me relief to know I have the option.

3) Certainly the above mentioned points as well as unique button placement. I find myself tapping the middle of other peoples' phones when I go to use them. Convenient for adjusting volume in pocket too. Double tapping volume up turns on the light, double tapping down activates the camera. These I use daily.

4) Availability of parts. I want the phone to last. Certainly looking attractive is a plus too. A phone is as much an accessory appearance-wise as a wallet. I could even live without removable battery in another phone provided there's still some way to replace it when its life begins to diminish. SD support is a must. Manufacturers will nickle and dime you for that extra space.

Android,gadorp,7613,"Originally: I was a Windows Mobile user since before it was Windows Mobile (Back in the early CE days, had several devices all the way up from the first Casio Casseopeia all the way to the HTC HD2) and when I started to see the writing on the wall for WinMo I jumped ship. At first it was to Blackberry, because that's where the corporate app sales were coming from and because my work supplied me with a steady stream of devices. I had been curiously eyeing Android since it was initially announced and I felt like it was the natural progression from the old WinMo days.

As soon as I could, I jumped over to Android with my first HTC in years, the Evo 4G. I loved it, love love loved that device. Sense was prettier and more useful than stock Android and, I'll admit it, I was an HTC fanboy since the SPV 100 (Canary). I still have my original Evo 4G, I've owned an Evo 3D, One X and now M8 since then, aside from the non-HTC devices I've had since then. It still works like a charm as a little project gadget. The others didn't fare so well, and I've kind of soured on them a bit since.

Currently: I have an HTC One M8 running the current stock Sense. I'm debating on converting to GPE since HTC and T-Mo seem to be slower than hell on deploying any update to MM.

I chose this phone because I had to give up my old phone for work and I wanted to check the waters on HTC's new(er) devices. I love the phone, even if it's now a bit too small to me. But holy crap these update schedules are ridiculous.

I think at least one of the things that sets it apart is the gorgeous SLCD3 screen. I'm so tired of pentil SAMOLED displays that look murky in sunlight and burn-in after a week (lookin' at you, Nexus 6) The phone's got a great look and feel, too. Solid, thin, a tank.

The most important features to me are a great display, good OEM UI (if I'm not on a Nexus, I want the least amount of OEM bloat you can give me) and updates (thanks for screwing this one up, HTC/T-Mobile)

I've had plenty of iPhones, but never as my personal device. I have developed iOS software but would never use an iPhone as my own, main device. It's too restrictive and the selection of hardware is non-existent.

Previous phones? (WAY too many to list, see above for a bit of info)

You can make whatever you want, there are no boundaries.

The learning curve is quite steep, I would say, I myself noped right out again after downloading it for the first time, but seeing what people create with it made me wanna learn to use it. After a bit I noticed that it is by no means as difficult as I first thought, also you don't have to make the themes yourself, there are a lot of people passionate about making them. (You will need the Premium Version to import other people's themes though, but it is worth it, believe me)

Check out /r/androidthemes if you're interested!

Note that not every theme over there is made with KLWP, but the creators will list the used Apps in their submissions, and KLWP is by far the most used (and the app with which you can get the most creative with.)

Stock handsets have never sold very well - think back to the Google Play Editions, pretty much every Nexus device - not big sellers at all. The most successful Androids have all been skinned by the OEM.
This could be because they are not heavily marketed, but whatever the reason it seems that the vast majority of buyers are happy with the custom versions they get on their Galaxy or whatever.

Go back even further though, and think about how ugly Android was in the early days. 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 - they looked pretty awful - particularly compared to iOS which was well established and nicely finished. So Samsung and HTC etc pretty much had to skin them to disguise the ugliness. They obviously took it too far, and things are a lot more toned down now from what they were, but 'stock' Android wasn't ready for mass markets looking like it did.

Back to today and I'm currently using an LG G2 with a stripped down 5.0.2 Rom (it removes the excess crapware but the 'skin' is still there) - its actually really nice to use and I would go as far as to say I don't really mind that its not Pure Android.

-Near stock Android

-Updates within 3 months of a main release and within 1 month for security

They keep their cut for as long as they keep up this, so let's say Smasung sells 10 millions S6's and they get 5% of the sale from a playstore purchase if a user spends just $5 on IAP, apps, movies, or games from a S6 or on PC to a S6 Samsung will make $2.5 million.

Android has far more if you count not only the Play Store, but also all the apps availiable from other sources, like fan forums and alternate app markets.

Additionally, the ""better, more polished"" argument is entirely subjective. Apple has a strict approval process, meaning many great apps get rejected for idiotic reasons. Meanwhile, on the Android market, you can download apps that are specifically made for hacked devices, or apps that are still being tested.

Sure, this may tarnish the ""polish"" for a casual, tech-illiterate user, but this adds tremendous flexibility to Android devices.

If you get an iPhone, you're basically stuck with whatever they want you to have. Sure they have an app store as well, but they're overly picky about what is and isn't allowed to be there.

Rooting gives you total control over every part of your phone. If you do the wrong thing, you can easily brick it.

Right now, I have a PS1 emulator installed, which is very smooth. It's awesome being able to play Final Fantasy VII on the train :D

The Clockwork mod recovery now officially supports the Desire HD too, so using ROM manager, you can set automatic backups that you can restore everything from (if you like to fiddle like me, this is handy, e.g. when flashing new ROMS/Kernels goes wrong, it's as simple as restart->hold vol down-> restore, BOOM! Fixed).

Most of the big games (and no doubt apps in general) from the iPhone are coming over to android, or are already here i.e. Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and soon Cut the Rope. 

Depending on the usage, I get anywhere between 12 to 24 hours out of the phone, though as I get more used to the phone, (and stop playing with it every waking moment) the battery life is creeping more towards the 24 hours.

Also, in landscape, when typing the keyboard is PERFECT. It's almost as easy as typing on a normal keyboard. 

The only (yes, ONLY) issue I have with the phone, is that the mail app on the default, stock ROM doesn't work with Hotmail's activesync service (but HTC know about this, and no doubt 2.3 will fix it soon, and there's many alternatives on the market).",2,positive,"Main object: HTC Desire HD and Android

It's only 8mm taller and 10 wider than the iPhone4, so if you can handle the iPhone size, you can handle the Desire HD. The big screen is well worth the investment, everything looks awesome on there (and with that big ole' 1GHz processor plus 200MHz graphics processor, it's handled up to 720p for me, ain't tried 1080, but it'd be pointless to anyway).


Yeah, it's a bit annoying that they stuck a slower processor in the Z, It would've been better as the Desire (with the same spec) plus keyboard, but I still think I'd have gone for the HD.


And being HTC's flagship phone, it's a pretty sure thing that we'll get Gingerbread soon.

Android,shazoocow,4793,"Here is why... You are not their customer. Carriers are their customers.

Carriers want distinguishing characteristics so that they can sell ""unique"" products to their customers and reduce competitive overlap with other carriers. If everyone sold the same 1 version of the exact same phone, all they'd have to compete on would be the price/quality of service and that's the thing they want *least* in the world.

They want exclusives and feature tweaks so that they can leverage devices to gain subscribers. Even if the differences between devices are dubious, carriers can make marketing claims about being the fastest or the biggest or whatnot. They can also use those dubious differences to tell their customers that there's no equivalence to a competing carrier's offerings and that prices of service are therefore not negotiable.

Conveniently, it's pretty easy for a vendor to handle these customizations because the substance of the underlying product doesn't actually change all that much. The chassis might change or there might be some minor tweaks to hardware specifications, but the core development work is done and platformized. If you have to add a few months more work on the tail end of a 2 year development cycle to satisfy various customers who might each order millions of units, you do it.

This platform development approach also enables model refreshes, like for example when last year's top-end phone is re-released as this year's cheap junker or when a high end device gets a boosted ""plus"" version or something like that.",51,neutral,"Main object: Carriers and mobile devices

Android,Inigox5,1991,"Google Assistant Driving Mode is slow, buggy, and fundamentally unsafe. || I have used Android Auto every day for at least a year and, while it had its quirks, the concept was sound. Maps opened by default, tabs for media and calls - simple, effective and most importantly - **predictable**. 

Android 12 has forced the use of Google Assistant Driving Mode, and I *hate* it. Maybe it's because I'm using a Pixel 4a, but it is consistently slow to load, fails to respond to presses and often the toolbar at the bottom just doesn't load, and instead there's just a white bar. Bugs I guess I can excuse, but the fact that it changes every time means there's no way to build muscle memory and instead I have to stare at my screen, navigating unintuitive options ideally before I set off, but sometimes once I'm driving. The alternative is to just set everything up manually before I get into the car, but then what's the point of having a driving mode? 

So:

The home screen with suggestions has decided to relabel my home and work to ""[Nearby pub]"" and ""Parking lot"". Tapping them actually starts navigation about 50% of the time. The ""for you"" section seems to just open Spotify, not to the specific item I touched. Not to mention that once you're navigating somewhere there seems to be no way back to the home screen?

Maybe you get lucky and navigation starts **and** you get the bottom toolbar - does your media start autoplaying from last time? Toss a coin. If it doesn't, get ready to brave the app drawer - press the button, wait 2 seconds. Press it again, only for it to register the first press too and close the app drawer. Press it a third time, wait, wait, then you can finally select your media app from the list of things you mostly will never use - why is maps in the drawer? I was just there! I don't want Google Play Books, YT Music or Google Podcasts. Why is the settings its own app?! Why can't I customise this list in any way?

You've finally opened your media app - now you can choose the same thing you always do, right? WRONG! Here's a random selection of options that changes *every day*, and a call to action suggesting you use the voice controls - which I would, if I could make my phone use the in-built microphone! Instead, it tries to use my car's microphone through bluetooth which only activates when I have a call, rendering every voice control option useless to me. If you decide you would like to listen to something not algorithmically selected for you and tap the ""All"" button, there's another list which changes all the time. Where are my playlists? Where's my liked songs? The same thing happens with Pocket Casts too.

Once you've got your media playing, there's an icon at the bottom on the map screen. Pressing it once pops open the ""Pause"" and ""Next"" buttons. Couldn't possibly fit a back button in there..? Now when you try to close it, it's *again* 50/50 whether it drops back down, or instead opens the fullscreen player view. If you're reaching over to a phone on a wobbly windscreen mount, you can't be relied on to have perfect accuracy of touch - which makes the fine distinction between these two options a dangerous decision.

I tried using it for a few days, but have come to the conclusion that it's far too distracting and confusing to use while driving, and have instead delegated control to the passenger. Even they, with full attention, struggle to get it to do what we want to...

Dynamic layouts, unresponsiveness, multi-layer menus, and critical bugs leave this an unsuitable product for drivers, all just to get us to use the assistant a bit more? No thank you.


Edit: Thanks everyone for sharing your experiences - I was a little concerned I was complaining about nothing but it's gratifying to see people agree that it's not safe.
A few things:

* I refer to Android Auto meaning the separate app you used to be able to download and it acted as a replacement homescreen while driving. I don't have a head unit in my car that runs Android auto - my understanding is that **that** type of Android Auto is still the same as ever. Android 12 has forced me into using the Google Assistant Driving Mode because the Android Auto app basically says ""no can do, try assistant!"" now.

* I like the idea of a driving app because setting things up before I go may work for short drives but if I want to change the music or podcast I'm listening to, or change my destination mid-drive, this is much safer with a user interface designed for fat-fingered presses, or even voice control when it works.

* My main problem is genuinely the inconsistency. I hate that it's buggy, I hate the voice controls don't work, I hate that I don't have any power over many different options, but the part that I find dangerous is that **nothing is predictable**. Google need to sort this out before people die - /u/steerider put it well with the following: 

> Anyone who designs an app to be used while driving needs to put a sign on their wall:

Android,wilee8,10123,"Sorry I'm late to this, but you missed the most annoying part for me: Bluetooth autostart.

On Android Auto on my phone, I could select which devices I select which devices I wanted Android Auto to automatically start when connected to. This means I could enable for the car I normally drive (which doesn't have Android Auto built in), but leave it disabled for the car my wife normally drives (which *does* have Android Auto built into the console). Then Android Auto would start any time I started my car (but not my wife's car) AND TURN OFF WHEN I TURNED THE CAR OFF. 

Assistant Driving Mode doesn't have that, it just have ""smart"" device detection that only allows me to enable autostart when it detects a car's Bluetooth. It's smart enough to not turn on for my Bluetooth headphones, and smart enough to turn on when I connect to Bluetooth in my car, but it's too stupid to realize it shouldn't turn on in my wife's car even when I connect to Android Auto in the console. And of course, it never turns off. 

The combination of these two means Assistant Driving Mode turns on any time my wife comes or goes in any car, whether or not I'm in the car or staying home, whether or not I would even need it in that car if I was going, and never turns off until I notice it has been enabled. Android Auto would occasionally turn on if my wife was taking my car, but at least it was smart enough to turn back off once she was out of Bluetooth range or turned the car off. Assistant Driving Mode is too stupid to do that.

I know I didn't really do anything for Christmas, I'm here to replace any horrible presents that you got! I had a poke around for some spare devices and the HTC Social Team offered a bunch:

* 2x [One M7 (US winner can choose carrier, everyone else gets GSM)](http://s.htc.com/17MSrov)

Android,jackie89,0,"Apple is demoing the Apple Watch on stage right now, what are /r/android 's thoughts on the device? || Perhaps asking this here is biased but let's hear some thoughts and get a healthy discussion going. 

Here's Verge's Live blog: http://live.theverge.com/apple-watch-macbook-liveblog-march-2015/?_ga=1.108976706.1318181320.1425919416

EDIT: Prices announced.

Apple Watch Sport: $349/$399

Apple Watch: $549/599

Apple Watch Edition: $10,000+

18 hour battery. 

EDIT# 2 - Thanks a lot guys for the amazing feedback and keeping the conversation healthy.

I'll try to summarize everyone's view here. 
Pros:

* New features like Apple Pay
* More apps at launch than Android
* Unique band switching system with a decent number of bands to choose from. Also creates a  market for third party exclusive accessories. 

Cons:

* Price - ranges from $350 all the way up to $17999.
* Design and UI for majority of the users.
* Lack of message about why I need one.
* Apart from few apps, nothing seems unique to the Apple version of the form factor. 
* 18 hour battery life, plenty of Android Wear devices already doing up 2 days.

So far, I think /r/android is unimpressed but excited to see what this means for Android Wear and how does the entire form factor move forward.

[Also, I feel like I should point out that BBC picked on this thread and even quoted a user.](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31805655)

Android,patriot95,2190,"I really think the answer to smart watches is somewhere between the Samsung Tizen / Apple Watch's strategy of Apps on watches and Android Wear's purely notification strategies. I don't think any of them are near perfect or polished yet.


I did see that the Apple Watch can answer calls. Is that on the watch with a mic/speaker? Because it has wifi support and if I could just not have my cell at home but still make/receive calls on a watch I'd love that. Also, NFC needs to be on all smart watches. Come on, Android Wear.


Also the price is insane, but the build quality looks to be very good. Battery life was good enough. It didn't make me jealous of what iPhone will have, but Android Wear and other offering haven't made me want a smart watch yet, either. Mainly I just hope this makes smart watches more mainstream so all competition is upped. I mean come on Samsung, make a Gear Love with the S6 Edge's bent edges and I'll throw money at you.

That said this is assuming the use cases for the watch are similar to what are the use cases on the  phone. We don't do on our phones, mostly, that we do on our laptops. Same way we wont do on a watch that we would do on our phone. So a new set of use cases will emerge over time. And with a well built out platform Apple has got a decent version 1 device out.

I don't like that weird, cluttered, ugly looking polka-dot UI you have to zoom in with a tiny knob you have to pinch  between thumb and forefinger.

Also, showing pictures to people on a one inch display just seems quite inconvenient with the big bezel, square design we've seen for over a year.

A Champagne Gold Moto 360 is, in my eyes, the best looking smartwatch overall with the Zen Watch coming in second. I just don't think Steve Jobs would ever release something that looks so cluttered and intuitive. 

One wheel and a button was revolutionary for the iPod. This is basically, a wheel on a tiny watch with tiny polka dot icons... I just don't see it being iOS-y or Apple in nature. Apple is ""So simple, your grandma can use it."" 

This seems cumbersome, burdensome and nobody wants to be tinkering with their tiny 1 inch display turning a knob to use it. Google's card style is perfect, lots of swiping, not much pinching, zooming or tinkering.

I personally dislike the design, especially the crown/side button layout. That's my own opinion though. 

**Features:**
Feature-wise, the Apple watch, if it performs according to apple's word, is ahead of the android wear competition. Some features are rather gimmicky though. Why on earth would you send someone your heartbeat or answer calls on your watchin public? 

Most of the apple watches features could be brought to android wear with software updates. 

**Price:**
I don't own a smartwatch since the current prices are not worth the benefits. The price isn't surprising. I would be interested in sales figures though...

**Specs:**
Why oh why can't companies publish detailed specs on the day of announcement? Actual real life battery usage stats will be interesting and make or break the watch for many consumers.

Android,Destroya12,0,"I like the interchangable clasp idea. Makes for good collecting, and variety of materials. You just know that case makers are jumping over themselves to make new designs and materials. Waiting to see what comes of that. 

I like the digital crown idea. Mixed with a touch screen was a good idea. 

I like that they incorporated NFC. In the future this means that we could share information and data once Apple gets its head out of its ass and decides to use NFC for something other than Apple Pay. 

I don't like the chunky square design. Seriously, this thing looks bulky and ugly, though I'm sure that's so they can reveal one that's ""24% lighter and thinner"" next year. As for it being square, I don't know what they were thinking. Moto 360 was shown off months beforehand, so it's not like they didn't know that circular watches were well received. If they had to go with something square, why not make it more elegant and have the display be curved a la Gear S? Another question: Why didn't Apple invent this category? Why did Wear and Pebble beat them to it? A few years ago they may have genuinely been the first, but no longer. Apple's creativity is slipping. 

The UI I don't like either. Apple is supposedly known for its easy to use interface, and they laude how they use tablet screen real estate so much better than Android, etc. But then they go and reveal their watch interface as essentially just a row of icons again. Seriously that's what it is. It scrolls diagonally, but it's still just a row of icons. Uncreative and really hard to navigate on a screen 1.5"" diagonal. The apps themselves look ok, albeit less colorful and playful than Wear's apps. 

The sending your pulse thing is cool, but I wouldn't buy a watch just for it. 

Price. There is simply no reason for these things to be this expensive. My Moto 360 was $249 when I bought it and I felt like *that* was too much. Smart watches should ideally be $200 or less in my view, save for that 18 karat gold option. I like that they made that because it makes smart watches seem like something legitimate watch enthusiasts could own, not just tech nerds on the internet. But even still, the Sport is too expensive, and the watch is WAY too expensive, and we still don't have any word on specs. 

Considering how Jony Ive literally told us today that battery life doesn't matter I'm also worried about battery life. My Moto 360 is barely acceptable at roughly one days use, and Motorola products usually run circles around Apple's in battery tests. Not to mention reports of it's battery being shitty in the 1st gen so they can turn around and make it merely adequate in the 2nd gen. 


On the whole, I'm sure it'll sell. Apple could literally just package Tim Cook's dog's rusty turds and it would sell. As to how it'll stand up against Wear as a product remains to be seen.

Android,gedankenreich,166,"- I'm not a big fan of the design and think the press would have laughed about it if Samsung or a different company had made it
- the prices of the bands are a bad joke...
- I think it has too many ways of input to be convenient and ""quick"" to use
- the UI has many very small touch targets - again I see a problem with using it quickly and getting the information you want at a glance
- it looks like there are too many animations that slow it down until you get done ... probably they did it to win some seconds for the processing  in the background. Apple has always been good at ""hiding"" performance issues from the user.

+ the only positive thing is that apps seem to be easier to access then on Android wear (without voice). I'm not a fan of the grid apple used, but it's at least quicker than Googles approach.  Personally I would prefer a quickly accessible list view like we've seen in some third party launcher

I think the big question is again ... would you use this watch or pull out your phone (that it requires) to get something done? 
Can you leave the phone at home and use it for sports? Doesn't sound so. A Sony SW3 with build-in GPS can do it better, or a Gear S which is almost like a phone on your wrist.

Using it for notifications what most people want to do? At the moment it looks to me like the Android Wear UI is much cleaner and faster to use for this approach. Clean text, simple UI, big touch targets ... that's what it needs to get such things done fast. Even a Pebble might do it better. 

So the Apple Watch is somewhere in between. Probably too complicated and messy for a good device to deal with notifications and too limited to be a stand-alone device for sports to leave the phone at home. It will be interesting to see what it can do without a phone. 

It's just my first thought. So far I don't think that anyone has really nailed it yet, but Android Wear is a ""bit"" closer with it's more minimalist approach (imho).

I like the fact that Google maps tells me when there is traffic on my route.  When restaurants are busy.  When I have an appointment I forgot about.  When my flight has been delayed.  ect. etc.

1. Privacy is an entirely different thing than data-mining. You could have huge amounts of user data securely kept, you could have tiny bits of data insecurely kept, and vice versa. 

2. In general, optimizing advertisement to fit user data is IMO a net positive for users. Gone are the days when marketing was one-size-fits-all like this product or else. Nowadays, it's an arms race to be as targeted to a segment of users and their particular needs as possible.

3. The real danger is in creating behavioral patterns that lead users to unhealthy lifestyles, undue privacy risks taken, unnecessary disposable income spent, etc. which is why you're starting to see Google and Apple now focus on quality of life management.

4. There is near zero risk (from Google at least, FB moreseo) that your data is being particularly targeted by them. There is simply too much fucking data. If you are in the EU, there's even less risk due to GDPR. To use an analogy, my buddy who worked briefly with the NSA said that the people there might have all the data in the world but could barely finish reading their own emails. This is true of all Big Data.

5. Yes Google locks you into it's own ecosystem. Per point #4, this ecosystem is not a jail cell constrained to super personal data about you.

Android,TechGoat,4034,">Google locks you into it's own ecosystem just as much if not more than Apple.

I mean, you're not wrong about all the tracking that Google Play Services does. All the stuff that lowers our battery usage by not making each app fire wake commands; instead using Google's scheduler. Having each app not need to ping the GPS, instead asking Google's last record of our GPS location so there's only one check instead of however many apps you might have wanting to know your location, etc etc. I view that as a feature, not a bug.

But I in particular disagree with your statement about lock in, because for me that's the defining difference - the app stores. Apple gives you one: their own. Google and Microsoft's Windows have this in common: sure, they have their preferred app stores. They'd love it if you only use that. But they do let you install applications from other places. Raw APK files? No problem. Amazon App Store, getting Android Source code but then laughing all the way to the bank on their Fire branded stuff? Google probably hates it, but they allow it. And then more benign nerd stuff like F-Droid and Humble Bundle - it's all allowed.

I don't feel locked in on Android. Sure Android has problems, I will shout it more than the average person.

Maybe you used a wrong term, but locking into an ecosystem means that once you use some product, you are forced to use other products by the same manufacturer. Google search is a standalone product which no one forces you to use.

What you wanted to say is that they have a monopoly on search engines. That is also true, but by the market share, not because there's no alternative. There's Bing, there's DuckDuckGo, and there is also Yandex. The latter is, unlike the others, supported by a company in another country, which is advantageous if you are in the US and don't want the US-based companies/government to collect the data on you.

You can use any of a number of different apps to send SMS messages. You can have addresses (e.g. in text messages) use a different map application (like Here) by default. None of that is possible on iOS.

The reason you feel like Google locks you in, is because they actually make better apps. Google Assistant is way better than Siri. Google Maps is way better than Apple Maps. Google Photos is way better than Apple Photos. The iOS Gmail app is much better than Apple's native mail app.

I don't mean to bash Apple, there's a lot to like about iOS and iPhone's. For instance, even though they were the first to remove the headphone jack, their wireless earbuds are arguably *still* the best ones out there. Whereas Android OEMs (including Google) removed the headphone jack without a good replacement.

You aren't locked in. You can use any google service on any other operating system and platform. You aren't locked into using google as a search engine, you just choose to use it, because it's the best. 

Apple LOCKS you in. You can't use iMessage an Android, or PC, for instance.

>Contrast this to Google, who is actively enforcing data privacy rights in their store.

There isn't a ""contrast"" here. Apple is even more stringent with Privacy Policy requirements in their App Store than Google is. The Google Play store only requires a developer have an official privacy policy if the app ""handles personal or sensitive user data"". ([Source](https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security-deception/personal-sensitive/)). 

Apple, on the other hand, requires EVERY app have a Privacy Policy and display it in the app as well as online. ([Source](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy)). They also have much more rigors guidelines around how developers are allowed to use the data they do collect, including explicit requirements to minimize data collection to that required for the ""core functionality"" of the app, and prohibitions on repurposing data for other non-related purposes. 

>While apple does offer this, they make it very difficult to control these things, and that's no accident.

Not at all sure what you mean by this. Apple has EXTREMELY intuitive privacy explanations (written in plain language) and controls in their OS. It's also very easy to access and download data they have on you.

NotiStar let's you keep a history of all notifications, & Tasker Changer let's you customize your open apps quick screen (tho the update for Android 11 is pending on this one for now). 

Then there's Dex mode which gives almost a full laptop experience for 90% of what I need. I'm able to use it on my tablet to better multi task with the keyboard cover.

Sending gifs in messaging apps are a chore in iOS. You have to copy and paste them as opposed to just pressing it on Android.

Android,ok___google,1,"You basically nailed it. Everything you say in this post are the most common complaints I see about iOS, and they’re all fair. I don’t have anything to say about that.

Back when I was on Android a couple years ago, I stuck with it because it was generally cheaper, I was able to side load apps extremely easily with different app stores (especially when different third party app stores offered apps that were paid for on the play store, for free), easily get GBA emulators, easily manage my music/media through the files directory, root/customize to get different themes and functionality, install APKs to get immediate access to app updates, etc.

That said, things change, people change. Your priorities as you grow can change. I realized, after bricking my second to last Android device by messing up somewhere along the line while rooting, that I had had enough and it wasn’t worth the headache anymore. Not saying that it was Android’s fault or anything (it was my fault for messing with my phone after all), but after that experience, my interest in the whole customization or tinkering with my phone thing completely diminished. And without this interest in heavy customization anymore, I realized that Android wasn’t really for me anymore.

All that said though, having used both platforms for extended periods of time, I think most will agree that they both have their pros and cons. Everything in your post is a con, and it’s all fair. It’s up to the user to decide what you prioritize, because there are some things that one platform does better than the other, and vice versa. Depends on what you value most. 

iOS might be “boring” to you if you like to tinker and mess with your devices a lot. But to someone who doesn’t like that or care about that, a generally more simplistic approach is probably going to be better for them",9,neutral,"Main object: Android

Android,SlyPro,334,"**Notifications:**
Android gets this one hands down. Every time I check notifications on an iPhone, I want to bleach my eyes. For a fairly user-friendly OS, the notifications are a nightmare.

**Apps:**
This one is a toss-up. Android has ways better flexibility with side-loading, YT Vanced, etc. However, I phoned trends to get apps first and they tend to be better designed. Sometimes developers just throw some shit together and feed it to us peasants, while iPhones look down upon us from their thone of well-developed apps.

**File Management and Handling:**
Easy win here for Android. I should be able to use my phone as a flash drive/computer, or to easily send my friend a file that they can move around and open with whatever application. On iOS, it feels like walking when you're thinking about it too much. ""This *should* be straightforward, so do I feel like I'm playing [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html)?""
I'm not sure if this is still an issue, but settings intends/handling for certain file types used to be (and may still be) an issue an iOS. I should be able to specify which app I open PDFs with, not just the one that daddy Tim tells me I can use.

**Privacy:**
Still iOS, though android 11/One UI 3 on my S20 is a step in the right direction.

**""It just works"" factor:**
Still have to give this one to iOS. I can give it to my boomer parents and less tech-savvy people and not have to worry about helping them as much. The cost is a more restricted environment, but for people like that, it doesn't matter. There's a certain sad simplicity about sending someone a message and just opening the Messaging app. The downside to this is that many iOS users have the attitude where there would rather YOU buy an iPhone than THEM have to install a 3rd party messenger.

Apple still wins here, great support for older devices. You're pet much stuck with Samsung if you want something that even comes close on Android",6,neutral,"Main object: Android

Being able to put hella apps on the Home Screen: what do you mean by this? Curious because one of the main complaints of iOS is that (prior to iOS 14 and the app drawer), all your apps are forced to be on the Home Screen.

Back button: to an extent, agree. However, most apps let you use the swipe back gesture. Most of these apps let you swipe back from the middle of the screen as well. I hardly ever use the arrow at the top left because most apps I use, like all the social media one, allow the back gesture from the middle of the screen. You just have to get used to it.

Closing tabs one by one: pro tip. If this is Safari you’re talking about, to close multiple tabs: go to tab view, and then press and hold on the “Done” button on the bottom right corner of the screen. It’ll show an option to close all tabs. Should it be hidden like this? Absolutely not. But it’s there. 

Not being able to choose default music player: Agree. That said, in the upcoming iOS 14.5 update, you’ll have the option to choose the default player when you use Siri.

In 2007 or so I got myself a MacBook Pro because everyone around me was so hyped, it was the second and third coming of Christ, and it was just the most basic shit. I had to get a subscription for some software just so I could write to my NTFS HDD. And special programs for almost every function, almost always costing money and half the time the answer just being ""no"". At least bootcamp was a thing and I could throw windows on it to have an actually functional OS if I needed it. And still to this day I find random .dsstore files in random folders because apple needs to litter those everywhere.     

And it's still like that, I do tech support for my family because too many of them need to use iOS, and more than half the time my conclusion after sitting with them for an hour or two is, that X simply cannot be done on apple. You can buy this subscription for 5€ a month for thing X you need once every five months, or buy this app for 30 bloody €, or it just simply, *cannot be done*. But ""it just works"".    

Apple really is some kind of religion because I do not understand why people put up with all of its issues, while Calling it the best thing in the world.

And that is that you have to actively maintain all of those versions for security reasons.

Personally, I'd strongly suspect that they'd split the difference and have what are essentially LTS releases every few major versions, so maybe they have an A13 release that can run almost everything prior to A13.  And then expect A14-A16 to be able to run any A14 app.  And so on.

Now on to the topic at hand. Qualcomm invented key technologies that underly CDMA 2G, CDMA and UMTS 3G (1xRTT, EVDO, WCDMA), and 4G LTE. Any chip manufacturer is welcome to implement any of those cellular technologies in their chips. Qualcomm signs up the handset OEMs as the licensees to those technologies (plus other patents that address a very wide range of other technologies in a a smartphone), in exchange for a royalty on the wholesale price of the handset. That applies whether or not the chips used inside the handset are made by Qualcomm or anyone else. So an OEM that uses chips from Samsung or MediaTek still has to pay a royalty to Qualcomm. Qualcomm's chip business and licensing business are actually handled by two separate companies (QCT for chips, QTL for licensing). 

In short, it is not the chip makers who are Qualcomm's licensees, it is actually the handset OEMs.

After using my Nexus One for several months, I would not give it up for an iPhone (even if it was free), for the following reasons: 

* Android's notification system. Notifications appear on the top bar and are only dismissed when I touch on the them or hit the clear button. 
* Android's multitasking. I know, iOS has a form of multi-tasking, but after using iOS 4.2 on my iPad for over a month, I can say Android still has the better implementation since iOS' multi-tasking is opt-in and Apple restricts the types of things that can run in the background (for example, can an iOS developer create an Alarm clock application that will run in the background?). Also, Android will display ""on going tasks"" in the notification bar/window - this is useful for Music applications, for example. 
* Cloud Message platform. Chrome2Phone is quite awesome, and in my opinion is Android's *killer* app. Cloud messaging differs from iOS's push notifications in that you can send actions (as opposed to simple messages) to an Android phone. 
* Storage is upgradeable (SD card)
* I can install applications from any source I choose. 
* I can write an Android application and only give Google money if I want to put my application on the Market. 
* Access to the file system (I know this is probably not a selling point for most consumers).

Android,flexnerwinterstein,2390,"Why don't manufacturers let their users choose between their customized and stock Android versions?  || I'm sure this has been discussed already, but I'd like to throw the question into the wild again. 

It wouldn't hurt them to have their version of Android shipped by default, and have the possibility of running stock Android if some users choose to do so, would it? ",0,neutral,"Main object: Android

Sentiment: Neutral",neutral
Android,Unknown,0,"> Why don't manufacturers let their users choose between their customized and stock Android versions? (

There are a few possible reasons:

- Manufacturer customizations sometimes run deeper than just the launcher.

A good case in point would be HTC's Sense, which implements several options that can only be found in Sense ROMs.  Some of these are critical only to the Sense launcher but still need to be part of the system; others are useful tweaks that are sometimes accessible even without going through Sense.

Providing both stock Android and the manufacturer skin on such devices would mean unnecessarily large ROMs as they may have to provide both the original and the customised versions of some files and libraries.  It can also mean potential conflicts as apps access the wrong libraries or files and hence behave in an unexpected, possibly fatal manner.

- Branding

Samsung's TouchWiz and HTC's Sense are very distinctive.  You won't mistake a Sense homescreen for anything else and this helps manufacturers distinguish their phones from their competitors.  Running stock Android removes that level of branding from the phones, meaning that manufacturers can only shout out their brand on small things like bootloader startup screens and logos on the phone, or with harder-to-implement stuff like distinctive design (eg. Motorola's current RAZR series).

- Existing customer familiarity

If you've used a TouchWiz device on, say, Windows Mobile 6.5, you will be largely familiar with how things are if you move to an Android phone running a newer version of TouchWiz.  This creates a sense of familiarity in users and  functions as a subtle psychological lock; the time and effort needed to learn a different interface can cause a buyer to decide to stay with one manufacturer.  Manufacturers know this and hence value familiarity across their product line.  

Running stock Android means that users will have familiarity with the entire *Android* line instead.  By allowing the running stock Android, therefore, manufacturers lose their hold on their existing customers, since now the customers will no longer have that psychological barrier and are free to move to a different manufacturer's phone.

All of these reasons do negatively affect manufacturers to some degree or other.

It should be noted that there is a trend nowadays towards lesser and lesser modification of Android.  Sense 4.0 is significantly less heavily customised on the surface. Sony's Timescape and Motorola's Motoblur interface has become largely stock Android on the surface. TouchWiz, although still looking the same, has always been easy to replace with a custom launcher with little ill effect.  But the desire to differentiate themselves on the interface level is still there for the reasons I mentioned, and stock Android prevents that.

**tl;dr:** Don't expect to have both the customised skin and stock Android on a phone any time soon.",5,neutral,"Main object: Android

Sentiment: positive",positive
Android,Unknown,0,"Some possible reasons:

- Lower development and support costs

No need to invest in R&D to make your own custom skin and make sure it will function like an Android app would expect.  No need to worry about the need to provide tech support for bugs stemming from your latest adaptation of your skin to the most recent Android version.  Security problems are patched for you with every iteration of Android.  Access to a repository of standard/stock driver code.

These cost savings are part of what makes Android attractive to smaller phone manufacturers, who can invest their capital towards procuring better parts for better phones.

- Better performance

The most distinctive skins like Sense and TouchWiz *always* perform less optimally than the stock version of Android simply because the launcher has either significantly flashier (and hence more resource hungry) visual elements.  Sometimes, the deeper level modifications lead to the need to have extra running services which, of course, mean lowered battery life and less free CPU/memory resources for other threads.

Running stock gives you an almost guaranteed speed boost over any competing phone of the same specs that don't run stock.  This in turn makes it possible for you to provide a snappier phone with a better user experience at a lower spec and price point than you otherwise would need, making your product more accessible to the market.

- Customer goodwill

The tech-savvy Android user wants an Android phone because they want to use *Android*.  Stock Android gives a blank slate for these customers to twiddle with and customize, which is part of what attracted them to the OS anyway.  Custom skins encourage manufacturers to lock down their phones to prevent modifications that remove or substantially modify the skins, which pisses off the power users since said lockdown limits their ability to do what they please on their devices.",2,positive,"Main object: Android

ex. If i open the messaging app on the dock and then went to certain conversation. and then i try to open the app again but in the app drawer,  it restarts and will go back to list of messages, and when you press back button, it will go back to what's opened on the DOCK.. 

You can get a multiple backs if you open the messaging app simulteniously from dock and app drawer.. 

It's only the messenger got that weird  behaviour, i tried other system apps but they all seem fine..

EDIT: Phone is nokia 6 .. running 7.1.1 stock android .. messaging app and other system apps are google's .. 


EDIT2: Problem fixed by removing the default messanging app given on the dock on its first launch. then replaced it with the app dragged form the app drawer..",2,negative,"1. Main object: Android

Android,MishaalRahman,57012,"Google's botched Pixel 6 update and the Android security patch conundrum || Google has rolled out a monthly security update for its Pixel phones at the beginning of each month for the last several years. The January 2022 update for Pixel phones started rolling out on Tuesday, but Google’s latest Pixel phones — the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro — won’t be receiving the update until later this month. A couple of weeks of delay doesn’t sound like a big deal, but Google previously [halted](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused) and [pulled](https://9to5google.com/2022/01/04/google-delists-december-2021-update-pixel-6-pro/) the big December 2021 update before it rolled out for most Pixel 6 users — meaning most users are running a build that’s two months out of date (and potentially [getting their enterprise access revoked](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/rxiv5r/enterprise_account_disabled_due_to_update_fiasco/)). Considering that the January 2022 update fixes the [very serious emergency calling bug](https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63), it’s a bit worrying that the update has been delayed!   

I think it’s fair to say that Google strives to roll out updates as quickly as possible for its own Pixel phones, and indeed no one can argue that Google is slow at rolling out updates. Perhaps the combination of the winter holidays, the laundry list of changes to merge from [the first Android 12 Quarterly Platform Release](https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-4-powered-by-esper), the switch to developing for its in-house Tensor platform, and carrier testing and retesting resulted in the one-week delay and eventual cancellation of the December 2021 update and the multi-week delay of the January 2021 update. It’s normal for some bugs to go unnoticed before an update goes out, because it’s impossible to catch every issue in the brief time they have to test. Nevertheless, this delay highlights a flaw in how Google handles Android’s monthly security patches, so in this post, I’ll be diving into the monthly security patch process and identify an area where Google could do better.  

##The monthly Android Security Bulletin is always on time, even if updates aren’t  

Compared to Chrome and Chrome OS, Google has far less control over the distribution of Android. Google has to work more closely with OEMs, who fork AOSP to add their own software features and branding, and SoC vendors, who write the closed source drivers that enable hardware components. Rather than submitting patches for security vulnerabilities to the public AOSP repository and waiting for OEMs to merge them, Google created the monthly Android Security Bulletin (ASB) to coordinate the disclosure of security vulnerabilities and give companies time to merge and test security patches before public disclosure.  

An Android Security Bulletin has been published every month since August of 2015. Generally, the Bulletin goes public on the first Monday of every month, unless that Monday falls on a holiday observed by Google, in which case the ASB goes public on the next business day. By coordinating the disclosure of security vulnerabilities with OEMs and SoC vendors and privately sharing the patches one month in advance of public disclosure, Google is able to speed up the uptake of security patches and minimize harm to users. The more time that companies have to integrate and test security patches, the faster they’re able to roll out an update with those patches. The less time that hackers have to analyze and exploit the newly discovered security vulnerabilities, the fewer number of users that can be attacked.  

While you can predict when the next ASB will go live, you generally can’t predict when the software update with those patches will roll out. Google almost always rolls out an update on the same day the ASB goes live, though that obviously hasn’t been the case for the Pixel 6 series since its release. When it comes to most OEMs, the update may roll out weeks or months after public disclosure, but some of the faster OEMs push out updates within days. Google doesn’t like it when OEMs roll out updates too quickly, curiously enough. Essential’s former head of R&D, Jason Keats, told [*Android Police*](https://www.androidpolice.com/osom-ov1-exclusive/#:~:text=When%20it%20came%20to%20monthly%20security%20updates%20on%20the%20Essential%20PH%2D1) that the company was berated for pushing updates out too fast. “Literally, we would get yelled at by Google for being too fast… they would then say, ‘We will not allow you to push your update until the Pixel team is ready,’” said Keats in the interview. Dianne Hackborn, one of the most senior engineers on the Android team, [offered an explanation](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1473445076856676356/photo/1) for why Google disapproves of updates being pushed out by other companies on day one. According to her, security updates are pushed to Pixels only when they’re sufficiently tested to show no problems, so if other companies are pushing out updates before Google, then they may be doing so before the patches have been fully tested for regressions.  

There are some OEMs like Samsung that [consistently roll out](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-january-2022-security-patch-international/) security updates *before* public disclosure, which is odd to see given that Google shares the Bulletin and patches with its partners under an embargo that lifts when the Bulletin goes public. By pushing an update before the ASB goes public, hackers can theoretically discover what vulnerabilities have been patched by comparing the previous and current versions of the firmware, but it’s unlikely that this happens given how few days they have to do this before the ASB goes public anyway. Once the ASB goes public [on Google’s website](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin), any user can see the list of security vulnerabilities that have been addressed, though some of the technical details will remain accessible only to Google’s Android partners. 

##What’s on the Android Security Bulletin?  

Google is the single largest contributor to AOSP, so of course they discover many vulnerabilities themselves. Android is a huge platform, though, so many vulnerabilities are found by independent researchers or third-party companies. Vulnerabilities in AOSP aren’t the only vulnerabilities included in the ASB, though. Google also lists patches for the Linux kernel (which Android’s kernel is forked from) and closed source vendor components. Patches for AOSP and Linux kernel vulnerabilities can be picked from their respective upstream sources, but technical details on and patches for closed source vendor components are available only from the company that makes them.  

Once vulnerabilities have been disclosed, Google assigns them a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID, categorizes them by [type](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-12-01#type), gives them a [severity assessment](https://source.android.com/security/overview/updates-resources#severity), and lists them alongside their affected Android version(s). In addition, the ASB preview for Android partners lists the specific subcomponent that’s affected, a brief technical description of the vulnerability, and a short description of the fix that’s being applied. Google also shares a link to download the patches in a ZIP file as well as the latest binary of the Security Test Suite (STS), a tool that automatically validates whether certain patches have been integrated properly. The STS [doesn’t guarantee](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-oem-lying-security-patches/) that every patch has been integrated properly, but if a test has been written for a patch, then there’s a good chance that it’ll be picked up.  

Google discloses these vulnerabilities to Android partners about a month before the public Android Security Bulletin. The January 2022 ASB, for example, went public on January 4, 2022, but a preview of the ASB was shared with Android partners on December 6, 2021. Most of the vulnerabilities detailed in any given ASB are disclosed to Google in the two months before the Bulletin goes public, but in some cases, the time between initial disclosure and the patch being made available could be even longer. For instance, the (arguably harmless) escalation of privilege bug that I [helped discover in Android 12’s Fabricated Overlay API](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12s-fabricated-overlay-api-brings-back-rootless-themes/) was disclosed on October 11, 2021, and a patch was authored shortly after on October 18, 2021. However, the patch wasn’t committed to Google’s internal Android 12 branch until November 24, 2021, so CVE-2021-39630 was only addressed in the January 2022 ASB even though it’s been nearly 3 months since it was disclosed. On the other hand, the very serious emergency calling bug that I alluded to earlier was publicly disclosed by a Samsung engineer with [a patch to AOSP](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/packages/services/Telecomm/+/1903050) on November 25, 2021, which gave enough time for CVE-2021-39659 to be included in the January 2022 ASB.  

[*A screenshot of the public Android Security Bulletin for January 2022*](https://imgur.com/5qFcD8i)

Regardless of when the vulnerability was actually disclosed, OEMs get about a one month head start to integrate and test their builds before public disclosure. Before the public disclosure happens, though, Google may update the ASB preview to remove patches that are incomplete or which require more time to test. This happened twice with the January 2022 ASB, once on December 13 and again on December 28, a week before public disclosure. Details on these patches are kept under embargo until a future ASB, though Android partners are not required to remove any patches they have already integrated.  

(The term “Android partners”, by the way, has a specific meaning here. I’m referring to the [hundreds of companies](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/) that [have shipped or plan to ship](https://www.android.com/gms/contact/) an “Android-compatible” device, which is a device that meets [Android’s compatibility requirements](https://source.android.com/compatibility/overview) and ships with Google Mobile Services.)  

##It’s time to update the security patch level  

Once it’s time for the public ASB to go live, Android partners can then roll out updates containing these security patches. The time it takes to roll out the update varies, as previously mentioned, because of multiple factors. For one, an OEM may need to make additional changes to integrate the security patch if the patch conflicts with existing code. Second, the OEM or SoC vendor may discover vulnerabilities that only affect their specific fork of Android (many OEMs and SoC vendors publish their own security bulletins for this reason). Third, the OEM may need to integrate additional patches for vulnerabilities disclosed by SoC vendors outside of Google’s ASB. Patches for the [MediaTek-su vulnerability](https://www.xda-developers.com/mediatek-su-rootkit-exploit/), for example, were ready in May of 2019, 10 months before the patch was included in the March 2020 ASB. Fourth, carriers may want to recertify the build to ensure compatibility with their networks. Lastly, OEMs may choose to wait to roll out a security update so they can also release some feature upgrades at the same time (this is a problem I’ll get to in more detail later). Initiatives like [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html), [extended Linux kernel LTS](https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-kernel-long-term-support-google/?), [Project Mainline](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system), and the [Generic Kernel Image](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/generic-kernel-image), were designed to reduce the technical complexity of merging patches, resulting in speedier security updates.  

When the update is ready to be pushed, OEMs update a string in their builds to signal that the software contains the security patches listed in a particular ASB. This string, the system property ro.build.version.security_patch, must be set to the appropriate security patch level (SPL).   

Every month, there are two SPLs: a partial and complete SPL. The partial SPL ends with -01 in the string, while the complete SPL ends with -05 in the string. For example, the partial SPL for this month is 2022-01-01, while the complete SPL is 2022-01-05. The format of the partial SPL can be generalized as YYYY-MM-01 while the complete SPL can be generalized as YYYY-MM-05.  

[*The Pixel 4's January 2022 update declares the 2022-01-05 complete SPL*](https://imgur.com/a/mVHpTO2)  

Builds declaring the partial SPL must contain patches to all of the vulnerabilities affecting AOSP, which includes the Android OS framework, the media framework, system components, and Project Mainline modules. Builds declaring the complete SPL must contain patches to all vulnerabilities affecting AOSP as well as the Linux kernel and closed-source vendor components.  

Since the SPL is denoted by a string defined by the OEM, there’s no guarantee that the build actually contains all of the patches that are required for that SPL. Researchers in mid-2018 [discovered](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-oem-lying-security-patches/) a significant “patch gap” between the SPL many phones reported and what vulnerabilities those phones were protected against. Automated tests like the STS help OEMs ensure that most patches are included in their builds, fortunately.   

##What went wrong with the security patch process for the Pixel 6?  

As I mentioned previously, the January 2022 update for the Pixel 6 series won’t roll out until later this month, leaving most Pixel 6 users on the older November 2021 SPL. The reason behind the delay is related to connectivity issues discovered shortly after the December 2021 update rolled out to some users.   

Why were there connectivity issues in a build that [was already delayed by a week?](https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/13/pixel-6s-big-december-update-is-now-available/) Well, it was the winter holiday, so Google was probably short-staffed. Furthermore, the Pixel’s December 2021 update didn’t just include the patches disclosed in the ASB — it also included the changes from [the big Android 12 QPR1 release](https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-4-powered-by-esper) which were marketed as part of the quarterly [Pixel Feature Drop](https://blog.google/products/pixel/snap-faster-hear-better-and-do-more-your-pixel/). Android 12 was Google’s biggest OS update in years, and given the approximately one-year turnaround for its development, it’s no surprise that the initial release had a lot of bugs and unresolved issues.   

That’s another reason the December 2021 update was particularly noteworthy: [it fixed nearly 100 bugs in Android 12](https://9to5google.com/2021/12/06/pixel-6-december-update/). Fixing so many bugs and integrating the Android 12 QPR1 codebase necessitated extensive testing, but Google doesn’t do public beta tests for quarterly releases, so they had to test everything internally. The approximately 1.5 month long period for testing and certification was clearly insufficient this time around, though. Tying the release of a security update to a big feature update is risky, and this time, it resulted in the security update being significantly delayed.  

Merging the December 2021 patches, Pixel Feature Drop, and Quarterly Platform Release into one update is great for marketing and convenient for users, but these updates don’t need to be combined. Instead of having Pixel 6 users sit on a build that’s vulnerable to a [high severity denial of service exploit that could block emergency calling](https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63), Google should release a security update sans QPR1 changes. Alternatively, they could push an update that contains a few patches fixing only the most critical security issues, which is how they [fixed the emergency calling bug on the Pixel 3](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478801245942992896) series despite leaving it on the October 2021 SPL. Google knows how severe this issue is, which is why they even [backported security patches to Android 8.0-8.1](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478435883355365379) for OEMs to pick even though Google only commits to backporting security patches to Android versions [that are less than 3.5 years old](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478095149779537925). Google wants to release new security updates once a month and new quarterly platform releases once every three months, but there’s no reason they can’t step out of that cycle occasionally. Committing to a once-a-month release cycle has its benefits, of course, as it makes updates more predictable and less annoying for users. However, I believe an exception needs to be made when it comes to updates that fix major security issues — patches are immediately made available all the time for critical security issues that affect other software we use on a day-to-day basis.",1970,negative,"Main object: Android

With the disclosure of the vulnerabilities, and the public update for other phones, it keeps the Pixel 6 series vulnerable to what are now essentially n-Day exploits. It's very plausible for technical actors to examine what's changed in other images (and in Android source code) to identify specifics of vulnerabilities, and develop exploits for those vulnerabilities. 

This kind of thing is even a tongue-in-cheek joke when it comes to Windows. There's Patch Tuesdays when vulns are patched and disclosed, and Exploit Wednesdays.

Our Pixel 6 phones have been open to several critical RCE vulnerabilities since November. 

I 100% support the idea of decoupling feature releases and security releases.  Maybe have them loosely bound, so they can be packaged together most of the time, but the security patches should at least be tested and deployable independently of a feature release.

That sounds like a *potential* anti-trust issue, as it gives the appearance that Google is ensuring that it's own Pixel phones are always the first to get updates, including security updates, even if other manufacturers want to and are capable of issuing them more quickly, and actually in at least one case was doing so until Google made them stop.  

When it comes to Google's own explanation for the practice, I think one would have to look at the type of quality control or lackthereof that they exercise with OEMs when it comes to things other than updates and see if it is comparable to what they are doing with updates or if the updates was trying to preserve a selling point for the Pixel line.  One of the things Google implicitly kind of sells these OEMs on is that it'll be an honest broker of it's OS and updates, and not heavily favor it's own phones and only reluctantly dole out stuff to other companies on a delay.

So, I just walked out of a big tech store in Portugal (Worten, for those whom it might concern).

As I was walking through the Android aisle, I saw different people trying different phones, but there was a kind of comment I heard way too much. Things like: ""oh I don't want a folder with this kind of stuff"" or ""I really don't like this selection of wallpapers"", ""I don't like these icons"", ""I don't think I want those apps"" or ""where's the menu""?

So, my point is: consumers are still choosing ANDROID phones based on what they look like using a store demo, completely oblivious of the degrees of customization each phone provides. 

Android as a whole really needs to advocate for it's customization capacity and needs a whole marketing campaign like ""express yourself, make your phone yours"" or ""don't just take pictures of your face... Make your phone LOOK like you"".... Ok that's silly, but I think you get the point.

Hopefully it also means that more excellent mid-range phones with headphone jacks will be released, but I'm not holding my breath.

We can't even improve standard smartphone batteries. Excellent Bluetooth battery life and **longevity** are still miles away.

Everything of note that OEMs have done in the last 2 years at least that people would casually notice has been in software.

A lot of Snapdraon 870, Dimensity 8100-8200 phones, and even some Snapdragon 8 G1 phones, the idea is that they have decent specs (snapdragon 8 series perfomace, 6-8gb ram 4500-5000mAh battery) but sometimes the camara is lacking, sometimes the software is a bit crippled, software updates arent as common, you have older gorilla glass or even dragon tail, plastic casing. i guess it depends on where your priorites lay.

Also lately google has been liquidating the 6A for quite a nice price, 350 euro range and you get one of the best (if not the best) camera on a phone, the performance in numbers is around 75% of a flagship chip but in real world use its hardly noticable unless you game heavly, the only issue is the battery, 4300mAh isnt a battery for a modern phone.

Android,advice_munkee,1,"In the age of dumb phones I used to be super excited to upgrade to the next phone. First it was smaller phones. Then it was full colour displays or the first gen camera phones. Every year, new phones somehow made old phones feel old. Getting email on your phone used to be a cutting edge feature. 


 Then smart phones arrived. My first was an HTC desire in about 2010 held on to it for about 2 years probably due to contract more then anything. It was definitely limiting and upgrading from it was still interesting. Then I got a Samsung galaxy s3 and ever since I've keep my phone for about 3 years. It takes about that long for the accumulation of new features to be worth the outlay, but battery no longer lasting a day is the strongest driver for me to upgrade now. 


I might be getting older and less interested in staying at the forefront, but I genuinely think 20 year old me would have similar apathy for the cutting edge since the gap is so much smaller than it was 20 years ago. My phone today fulfils the idea a geeky teenage me had of a future where credit card sized computers existed. My phone can do so much more than I would have dreamed back then. I can do everything I want it to now. Seldom are thoughts of wishing this was better or that was better. Most new features are side show attractions now.  Measure my pulse? Wow that's cool, how many times did I use it? Not many. Pedometer? Neat feature. Three weeks later I want it to stop nagging me and go away. Etc etc etc. 

Point is most new features are gimmicks not truly valuable and the core smart phone experience has barely changed in almost 15 years.

Android,Unknown,0,"My thoughts:

>  There’s no headphone jack, *microSD card slot*, *wireless charging*, or water-resistance. Without these features, the phone is more frustrating to use on a daily basis, not less.


**On the complaints on the SD slot:**  this seems to be written by somebody who hasn't used a recent phone with an SD slot, I take it.

I have one on my S7: It's good for my photos and music on it, but most apps do *not* offer the option to store themselves or their data on the SD card. Oh, and raw photos? The Samsung camera will store those to your internal storage, for some reason. It really is mroe of a hassle than a feature to me: I'd rather have a 64GB phone than my current 32GB+64GBSD phone. I also have a Shield tablet, which supports the new adoptable storage system from android: sure, I can move apps to the SD card, but even an UHS3 card is *painfully* slow to run apps off.

SD card slots are great for low budget devices, because they offer a cheap way to get more storage, but the downside is that SD cards are slow as shit. But on an expensive phone that offers 128GB of storage? Honestly I wouldn't use the SD slot even if it had one.

**On wireless charging:** I have had it in my Nexus 5 and S7. After the initial thrill of testing it, I never used wireless charging again. It's slow, the phone gets hot, and when I actually need to charge my S7, I'm in bed, so the added benefit of wireless charging is close to nothing. It's actually less convenient: If I wanna read/watch videos a bit before I wanna sleep, and my battery is low, I still need to plug in a cable: to charge it wirelessly, I have to put the phone down.

Honestly, wireless charging right now is a bit of a gimmick. It's a nice bonus, but no, it's not an essential feature. If it was, why is the iPhone still the best selling device without having wireless charging?

However:

**The headphone jack:** this is indeed an essential feature, fuck anybody who removes it. And that's me saying that as someone that uses wireless heaphones almost all the time.

**Waterproofing**: maybe not essential, but this simply has become a feature you expect above the 600$ pricepoint. I hope the PH-2 is waterproof.",8,neutral,"Main object: Android

Android,Conjecturable,1,"Kinda depends on what you consider daily usefulness. 

Your friend is probably like me: will the phone work like a phone? 

As much as I love the feature set of my P6P, I will admit, I don't use them very often. So, at the end of the day, is it useful for me to have a device that struggles to connect to cellular, constantly killing the battery (some days faster than others so I never know how consistent my phone will last), updates that constantly brick the features of my phone, updates that don't get pushed out OR, would I rather deal with some background app killing and some stuttery scrolling? 

At the end of the day, if you are willing to buy into the Pixel experience, you are willing to put up with some shit and ""hope"" they get fixed eventually, so the 10 Pro makes more sense as a ""at least I know I can make calls"" device, which you can't rely on a Pixel to do right now. 

You can also solve the issue by just paying the Apple tax since it seems like all Android phones are give and take these days. You either get a phone line that SHOULD be great but is filled with ads and bloatware and hardware limitations based on the region you purchase (Samsung), a device that SHOULD be great but shits the bed more than Amber Herd (Google), or a phone that again SHOULD be great but they don't know what market they want to corner and has hundreds of kinks that makes you not want to spend the money(almost every other manufacturer).",1,negative,"Main object: Android

Any frame drops won't last more than a millisecond, but if you have a lot of them back to back to back to back, you're going to have either 1). Constant tearing 2). Constant stutters depending on how you decide to handle those missing frames.

Here is my reply that I was writing before they blocked me:

Or maybe it's that people think it is a certain way and then ignore evidence to the contrary and jump to predefined conclusions when they see something that might possibly hint that their beliefs are correct.  
A lot of things that are ""known"" to be a certain way are false.  
Personally I want far more evidence than what has been presented before I will say for certain that something is one way or the other. In this case we have contradicting reports. The fact of the matter is that the S24U also saw a fairly large drop in cellular call time compared to the S23. As a result, I don't think we can use those results from GSMArena to draw some conclusions like ""the Exynos modem is worse"". It might be, but you can't just choose to believe one benchmark and jump to conclusions based on that, and then ignore other benchmarks from the same site that doesn't seem to align with your conclusion.

The only reason I can see for this is control, and that just doesn't sit well with me with Twitter. Of course it is their product and their right but Twitter has evolved to become the world wide newspaper or town square. Major revolutionary events have used Twitter to document it and influential people all around the world have used it as their primary mode or communication.

Lets put it this way: I would probably recommend an iPhone for my mom.

Here is my list of annoyances (in no particular order) that I still have:

* Hard to find 3 button headphones (that can control volume). I know this is not a problem with Android per se, but it is still annoying.
* App crashes/problems: I find them more frequent on Android than on iOS. Even the Google apps crash sometimes (especially f-n Maps)
* Battery usage: 3rd party apps will sometimes drain the battery in no time because they are allowed to do more in the background than in iOS. Would be nice if the os monitored this and notified you if an app was using a lot of battery so you could kill the app.
* I miss the tap to scroll top thing from iOS
* I miss Airplay. I have a Chromecast, but I miss being able to stream anything from my phone to an airplay receiver. With chromecast, each app has to add support as there is no os-level support.
* Some settings are not accessible through the system settings: like whether to use Google voice for calls or not, I find it a bit odd that this is in the Google voice settings and not the dialer settings or better yet in the system settings.
* The lack of easily being able to do backups (someone mentioned this earlier).

Android,givewhatyouget,8559,"The Galaxy Bud Pros are uncomfortable || I'll start off by saying that I have been looking forward to the Bud Pros for a LONG time. I use my Buds+ nearly all day from my walk to work, calls/music at work, and on my walk home. I live in NYC so active noise cancellation is a big deal. Here are my initial thoughts from using the Bud Pros for a day...

#**Pros**
The sound, even for someone who's not an audiophile like me but is also not a novice, is noticeably better. The deep bass and less metallic highs are what stick out to me.

#**Cons**
The active noise cancellation is just okay which is echoed in most of the reviews I've seen so far. At the gym, I could hear the whirl of my elliptical, dudes chucking weights, and light conversation even with the volume at 75%~.  If you've ever tried Airpod Pros, you'll know they BLOW away the Bud Pros without question. Disappointing.


Arguably the worst aspect of these that I haven't seen anyone else online mention is how comfortable they are - or lack thereof. After an hour of having them in, I could not wait to take them out. The Pros are significantly longer than the Buds+ but aren't ergonomically shaped to the ear canal. The Bud+ rest flat against the inner ear and the Pros have a massive bulge that not only prevents a seal but also makes it painful if you move your ear in the slightest such as talking, smiling, etc.

Comparison of shapes - Pros vs Buds+
https://imgur.com/a/8DvKlGS

I'm going to try these out for another day or two and if that uncomfortableness is still there, I'm going to reluctantly send them back. I could have the Bud+ in my ear for a whole 6+ hour plan trip with no problem. These, I have to take them out after an hour.

Has anyone else experienced the ear strain like me?


**UPDATE**: Ordered some [AKG N400](https://www.amazon.com/AKG-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earphones-Silver/dp/B088CZR6TY) to test. Crinacle gave these the same score as the Pros. They have less battery life and okay ANC but keep the Buds+ form factor.

Mr Wu inadervently dropped his HUAWEI P30 Pro into water on April 18. Soon the phone lost response and he had to take it to the after service for help. The after service told him that the screen and motherboard were damaged and must be replaced, but not for free. Mr Wu pointed out that the official website of HUAWEI P30 Pro said this phone is rated IP68 for splash, water, and dust resistance. He then called the official after service hotline and was told that ""HUAWEI P30 Pro is rated IP68 for splash, water, and dust resistance,  but this was tested under controlled laboratory conditions"". Now we know what the so-called controlled laboratory conditions is: **block up the openings in the phone like speaker and charging port with specialized waterproof rubber** , then put the phone into static clean water at depth of 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. Yes, for the phone to be able to resist water, you first need to block the holes of the phone yourself. I undestand that water damage is usually not covered under warranty even for waterproof phones. But I don't think it's acceptable to test the phone in so-called labratory conditions that can never be met in everyday life use and then claim that your phone is water-resistance without disclosing the details of the conditions in advance.",82,negative,"Main object: HUAWEI P30 Pro

My personal pros:  
* removable battery [for me personally this is preferable to a sealed battery w/ moderatley longer life]  
* size [phones w/ 5in screens are the upper limit of what I'm willing to tolerate]  
* hardware is still modern enough for the average user  
* fairly easy to root and remove bloat  


Cons:   
* battery life is pretty average, but see above re: removable battery  
* carrier bloat, easily fixed  
* bootloader is locked, there is Safestrap but no true recovery/ROMs  


I think it's fine with debloat and a new launcher ie Apex, Nova. The only remnants of Touchwiz I see in my everyday life are the notification bar (I find its toggles useful even if the green is nauseating) and the fugly dialer

I guess the build quality is pretty okay, as the phone was used by a 5 year old quite frequently before I got a hold of it (was my Mom's old phone that she always let my little brother play games on) and while it doesn't look great, it could be worse. 

Okay, but seriously, it's an old phone and I've had it for about 2 years and the only thing I use it for these days is calling and sometimes browsing reddit if I'm too lazy to bring my tablet with me. And even then, sometimes I can't even properly dial a number without a crash or two.. I also have it charging 80% of the time, and after 8 hours of it being on battery and maybe 30 minutes onscreen time, the battery is always less than 40%, location and wifi disabled.

**Pros**

It's the only phone I have

Has a cool notification bar that can change colours. Use that to notify me of various notifications 

**Cons**

Still on Ice Cream Sandwich after Sony said it couldn't upgrade the phone

Slow

Unable to do all or any tasks quickly or at a decent speed

 Crashes, sticks at every available opportunity

 It takes 3 rings in a 5 ring call (voice mail cuts in at 5) to display who's actually calling and the bar to swipe

The Camera takes pics in blue but that's probably the sensor

The Screen somewhat responds to taps and presses. Probably a screen issue

From my viewpoint, this time it's something different. *You get a full 3x zoom at 8 MP as advertised.* It's a design decision from Oneplus, perhaps combined with a little bit of marketing buff, but it's in no way a direct disadvantage. You paid for an optical 3x 8MP zoom camera, you got one.

That aside, what would be really interesting, if pictures from the main camera (48 MP sensor) are better at 2.2x than pictures compared to the tele camera at the comparable main resolution. There's a chance, that the main sensor still outperforms the zoom sensor and Oneplus did it for good.

Android,Unknown,0,"This *might* be a technicality.

When we say the lens is 3x we are comparing the zoom lens to itself. The most zoomed in state has a 3x focal length of the most zoomed out state. In portrait mode, the images from two different sensors are combined to produce the bokeh effect. Then you need to make sure the two pictures are from sensors of the same crop factor, same focal length. It seems to me the sensor behind the zoom lens is actually capable of capturing 12MP but it was used as 8MP in as a zoom lens so the min equivalent focal length are matching the main lens. In portrait mode, however, the two sensors need to have the same crop factor to combine, so the sensor behind the zoom lens needs to read out the entire 12MP area.

Does that make sense? /u/ImKuya

As for why can't the sensor behind the zoom lens read 12MP all the time. I can think of two reasons:

* When the lens is fully zoomed out the equivalent focal lens needs to match the main lens.
* the border 4MP area might not be great quality, e.g. Vignetting. But in the portrait mode the problem is not important since it is less visible when two pictures are combined

EDIT: see this chart for illustration: https://imgur.com/a/WsdveHc

In smartphone portrait mode, it is very normal to use two pictures to produce bokeh effect, see:

https://www.androidpit.com/how-bokeh-effect-works-with-smartphones

If I am right, then the lens is truly 3x. Has nothing to do with sensors, just lens itself is 3x. But only the center pixels were read out in a zoom shot. You should not use the resolution test to calculate zoom to be 2.2x or 3x, zoom is only a property of the lens, not the sensor, not the area of the sensor that is actually used",7,neutral,"Main object: Smartphone camera lenses and sensors

Android,ohwut,1106,"Technically the way OnePlus is working their zoom is 3x optical. It’s just a really really strange way of getting there. It all comes down to the term “crop-factor”. 

Normally in a camera system everything is measured compared to a Full Frame 35MM sensor. When you shoot a smaller sensor such as APS-C you have a crop-factor of 1.5x. That’s because the sensor size is literally the same as cropping out the center of your FF camera at that size. 

They’re essentially forcing crop factor into the system by cropping the image off their 13MP sensor. They’re making a smaller sensor out of their big one instead of just using a smaller sensor. 

If OnePlus had just used a 1 micron 8MP sensor, the sensor would be an identical size and quality to the region they cropped and we’d never think about it. The end result is fundamentally identical to just using a smaller sensor to get there.

Oneplus gives us the pixel size in the specs (1.0µm for the tele) too. No prob here either.

I really can't say if there's a marketing or technical background to this solution (most likely both). But it's no fraud at all, customers get exactly what's advertised.

(The only real difference in this solution in contrast to a ""true"" 3x zoom is a slightly different focal depth field, if this would be a DSLR sensor you would see a difference in background blur.

Well get this. Camera B is literally just the APS-C crop section of camera A. Cropping to 18.6 MP on camera As photo would be IDENTICAL to camera Bs photo.

Pros: 

* Really sleak, executive design
* Near stock Android KitKat, really nice.
* Decent front facing and rear facing cameras.
* Feels nice to hold in the hand.
* Has a really good offer on the official Dell store right now.
* Frequent updates.
* Long battery life, will last around 3 days tops on a single charge (standby)

Cons:

* Performance is shocking. Dell says it is ""lightning fast"" with it's Intel processor but, nah.
* 1GB, decrease from the previous 2GB of RAM. For some reason, this makes the OS slow down like hell and runs like a graphing calculator trying to run KitKat.
* Crapware, a lot of it. Thanks Dell, basically forced me to root the tablet in order to remove that crap, which was slowing the tablet down EVEN MORE. 
* Hardly ever updated, they obviously don't care about the speed or performance of the tablet. We're presuming that we're getting Lollipop soon as an official update but nothings coming. We NEED lollipop.
* Lack of dev support. Finding a root for this device was pretty hard and I cannot find Cyanogenmod for it. :( I'm totally sure that Cyanogenmod will free this tablet from the horrifically slow OS experience Dell have forced us to live with.

Not a bad tablet, but aim for something.. better.

another great feature is the icon background - if your preferred icon pack doesn't have an icon for EVERY app you use, you can pick any icon, use it as a background and just overlay a scaled down version of the original icon.

Android,Unknown,0,"No real big complaints here, on 16GB model. I feel like it was good value for money, and really makes a lot of other tablets (The ones still advertising Android 3.0 as the 'latest Android OS') look incredibly weak and overpriced. Is it better value than an iPad2? Possibly not in absolute terms, but if you specifically want an Android tablet, its one of the best choices you could make.

I can run Firefox and easily install AdBlock Plus which makes browsing the internet much more pleasant, and this setup can be easily made the default for all apps.

Being able to hold the unit comfortably in one hand makes this way more usable for me than iPad-sized devices. Finish on my unit is excellent, hardware controls are minimalistic but completely adequate

Humble bundle games run great, performance in general is snappy across the board.

Battery life is really good, even when doing things that stress the GPU etc.

Works well with a generic 'conductive rubber' stylus, for graffiti text input, handwritten note taking or sketching. 

Some cons:

The default 'portrait-only' launcher is incredibly retarded when you are holding the tablet in landscape orientation and using apps that work just fine that way. It's just plain stupid.

Lack of USB mass storage support makes it useless with a car stereo or other player that has no MTP support - MTP seems like an awful protocol, transfers are slow and error-prone, at least on OS X and Linux. Plug this thing in to a USB port on a machine you haven't specifically loaded software (that you have to hunt down and find yourself) on, and nothing happens. Just plain shit implementation and platform support work from google here. I guess this is the case with a lot of devices with ICS/JB on them, but that doesn't make it good.


A nitpick -

The lack of a bundled digital clock widget is baffling - the lockscreen clock is digital, the little time display in the top right is digital, yet the only clock widget bundled is analog-only?

* Insanely good construction quality.  The thing just feels incredibly solid.

* It's quick.  Haven't had a single app or game even try to stutter.

* The size and dimensions are perfect.

* ***PURE ANDROID***.

* Pretty solid battery life.

* Easily rooted for tinkering.  I changed my DPI from the stock 213 to 160 so I have the traditional ""tablet"" interface instead of stock Nexus 7.  Love it.

* Not really a con of the device, but I had to send my first one back due to the screen lifting, which has all but since been eradicated.

* No first-party accessories yet.

It definitely does each of those things and has also become useful in many others: I use it to read and annotate PDFs, to help deliver my lectures (rather than having to shuffle papers behind a podium), and it has pretty much replaced my laptop for web browsing, even at home.



**CONS**

1) I have dealt with defects! Very slight screen lift (not enough to warrant a return, imo), an occasional flicker, and a really nasty ghost touch issue that forced me to do a warranty replacement.  Luckily, I bought from the Play store and so Google sent a replacement device that arrived three days after I reported the defective unit. So far (the last two weeks), the replacement device seems totally fine. 

2) The keyboard isn't ideal for doing a significant amount of typing so I use a bluetooth keyboard when I'm writing anything longer than a short email.  I really like being able to use it like a monitor, though, so that isn't a total con.

3) Another con that isn't really that much of a con is the limited storage.  It really hasn't inhibited my enjoyment of it in the least.  I don't use many large or graphics intensive apps, so even with 100+ apps installed I am not running into storage problems.  I've been using Drive to store all of my course materials and, between the campus wifi networks and using my phone as a hotspot, I am never without internet access.  I also rooted it right out of the box and use Stickmount in order to read from flash drives.

**PROS**

Android,andon21,776,"Let this be a warning to all nexus 7 owners. Once you put even a hairline crack into that screen you become the proud owner of a paper weight. The first time was completely my fault I dropped an 80 lbs weight on the screen *facepalm*. The second time I got a flip case and was super careful; would maul dust just for getting on the screen. Then one day I pop that sucker open and no response from the digitizer. Restart that sucker because I had a custom ROM and sometimes they freeze. Restart. No tart. Start freaking out, noooooo not again. After I eye rape that thing for a few minutes I found a hairline crack in the screen. Where it came from i'll never know. I'd managed to drop the first one a bunch of times before the dumbbell incident and had had no problems. However lo and behold a device I'd cared for as if it were my own young was cracked and now  useless. 

I decided against buying a third device simply because it would have been pretty irresponsible. If I mange to recover the cost of a third device from the sale  of the first two you can bet your ass I'd get another one. 

So yea I loved the nexus but be careful of cracking the screen. Dropping an 80 lbs dumbbell on the screen is far from a standard stress test but at the same time I have no idea what happened to the screen of the second device. I had managed to drop the first on many occasions without issue but the one I pampered still cracked.

Android,Unknown,0,"* The subpixel rendering is godawful. I know, people say that the PenTile pixels don't make a difference - but if you spend most of your time on the Nexus reading pdfs and other texts, it can become a big headache, very fast.

* Apps can't decide if it's a tablet or phone. Aldiko (which has other issues) opens as the phone version, which just looks ridiculous. Tablet games run for the most part, but a lot of them have UI elements that are designed for a 10"" screen. You may think it doesn't matter, but each control has about 1/2 the surface area it would if you were on a 10"".

* It really is optimized for consumers with constant wifi and more money than sense. I don't want to buy ebooks through the play store, but it's obvious that they paid a lot of attention to making sure that works remarkably well. I may, however, get subscriptions to some magazines through there. But buying content that needs wifi doesn't make sense when most of the time I don't have wifi (two hours on the train, then an office without wifi).

* USB charging is **slow**. Like, really slow. You'll leave it plugged into your computer overnight and come back and it'll be in the 70% range. Use the charger, and consider getting a spare if you plan on using it at home and work; the wall charger pushes 2A, which is 4x what most USB ports will do and 2x what, for instance, the current generation of Apples will push. (I don't know if anything on the PC side has 1A USB ports.)

* No default camera app. The first thing most people do when they get a totally new device is check out all the features - and there's no photobooth, no narcissism app available right out of the box to play around with. In fact, I'd say that overall I've been struck by how little Jelly Bean does right out the box that I think it should. So many behaviors that I think should be defaults are apps that have to be installed.

* The touch screen is super responsive (tested it out with that app that was linked recently) but you wouldn't know it from how most programs behave. I can't tell where the flaw is, but it's super annoying because every time the touchscreen misbehaves, it breaks my concentration.

That's all I can think of. All in all it's a handy device and light and small enough that I carry it everywhere. Android is really not what I hoped for, but I bought it sort of as a gesture of faith - I think google is going to keep making it better.",2,neutral,"Main object: Android

**Samsung Note 5:**

Pros: Currently fastest processor, 4GB RAM, fast camera startup, 64GB size, stylus, wireless fast charging

Cons: No microSD slot, no changeable battery, issues with multitasking


**Sony Z5 Premium:**

Pros: Best rated camera at 23MP, 4K videos on screen, waterproofing, microSD slot, front speakers

Cons: Price, no changeable battery, 32GB largest size, no Gorilla Glass, 5.5"" screen 


**LG V10:** 

Pros: Rubberized back for protection, microSD slot, changeable battery, 64GB, mini secondary always on screen.

Cons: Slower Snapdragon 808 CPU

**Motorola Moto X Style/Pure:** 

Pros: Water resistant, microSD slot, 64GB, great price

Cons: Slower Snapdragon 808 CPU, older Gorilla Glass 3

**Huawei Nexus 6P:**

Pros: Android 6.0, great price, 128GB size, fastest to get updates, cleanest ROM, front speakers, large camera pixels for better low light performance

Cons: No changeable battery, no microSD, “only” 12MP and no OIS, can only do Fast Charge via USB C compatible battery packs.. which doesn’t exist yet


____________________




A swappable battery can no longer be a necessity if you can Quickcharge from a small external battery pack like this one (just wish it was a wee bit smaller) http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Charge-Anker-PowerCore-10050/dp/B013HSQXZC/

We can also live without a microSD slot, as long as the phone has a large amount of internal memory.  What would be amazing, is a battery pack that can take a microSD, so you could transfer movies, music, photos while charging your phone on a trip (are you reading this Anker?).  The Nexus 6P screws up a external battery pack choice, as their developers reported that you can only use a USB-C battery pack for Fast Charge, which hasn’t been created yet.

In orders of speed, the Note 5 is the fastest with their Exynos 7420 CPU, the Nexus 6P and Sony Z5 comes in 2nd place with their SnapDragon 810, and the V10 and Moto X comes in third with the slower Snapdragon 808.  There is also a known issue with the SnapDragon 810 and throttling,  MediaTek is coming out this month with their Helio X20, which is reported to trump everyone else’s processor (even the unreleased Galaxy S7’s Exynos 8890), but no 5.7” screens are reported to use it yet.

In terms of Fast Charging, you can fast charge with the provided 5V/3A power adapter. And you can use any Fast Charge external battery so long as you have a USB Type-A to Type-C cable. The way you imply your statement, seems like you're saying the Fast Charging will *only* work on an external battery, and *only* one that has USB-C. External batteries don't have proprietary cables, and usually only have USB-A ports, to which you can use any USB-A cable with, whether it be USB-Mini, Micro, or Type-C. Just depends on the cable you already own, or buy.

Consumer handsets that do so will see an added sales boost, especially because the Nexus line isn't exactly consumer grade.

- Favorites section (http://i.imgur.com/YgvdNTk.jpg)
  - It's awesome to be able to quickly access your favorite contacts or group chats.
- Animated stickers (http://i.imgur.com/eKQmQgP.jpg)
 - There's not very many of them, but when I do send them to a friend who only has an Android, she gets very jealous.
- Chatting experience (http://i.imgur.com/3dSgyed.jpg)
 - When an IM has been successfully sent, there is a green circle line that goes around your profile image. When it reaches 100%, the message was sent. So much easier to see. It's also much easier to see who is typing in a group chat.
 - The IM bubbles look better
 - Clicking on contact name in the chat window, gives easy and fast access to ""Favorite, Video, Mute, and Archive""
 - When sending an emoji, picture, location, or sticker; using the ""paper clip"" icon is much more intuitive.

The UI feels a lot smoother than my iPhone (which isn't surprising considering the hardware is much more powerful), and it also feels a lot more organized because the home screen (which shows only your configured apps and widgets) is separated from the app drawer (which shows all your installed apps). But even this can be changed completely by using a different launcher (which can be installed just like any other app, without needing to root the phone).

The only downside so far is that the iPhone has much more mature apps for music production, Android's audio APIs are still very basic.",10,positive,"Main object: iPhone and Android

Android,SirVer51,13470,">* Every Android phone I've tried felt smoother than Apple's offerings. It might be their implementation of the refresh rate and animation speed but Android feels faster and snappier. Scrolling is near instant, closing and opening apps just flies by and everything is very satisfying overall.

I wonder if this is partly due to it being different rather than necessarily better? Because as someone who's exclusively used Android for the last 10 years, every time I've seen iOS in action I've thought, ""damn, they have the UI smoothness locked down"" - IMO only the Pixels come close.

>* Freedom! It finally feels like I actually own the phone instead of renting it for an outrageous one-off price. I can use a web browser that isn't Safari in a trenchcoat, install a youtube app that skips sponsor sections and doesn't show me ads, and overall do anything. I can finally use all the power a mobile CPU is giving me. It doesn't feel like a smarter phone, it feels like a computer in my pocket.

I have a low end Samsung. There are some good things and some very bad things about it. (It has a very hinky Wi-Fi, three times slower than my old Moto, measured multiple times; often does not auto-reconnect. A terrible step downward.) But the processor seems to be well up to the job, core performance is strong.  (But after trying to get the Wi-Fi fixed by Samsung three times, I've firmly decided to never buy another; my love for my desktop Samsung monitor notwithstanding.)

A *lot* of things about Google's stewardship of Android have bothered me in recent years. (I've been on the OS over a number of phones since 2012; I started out really liking it after moving from a Blackberry I had really liked when I changed carriers. Unfortunately, in recent years, the relationship has frayed considerably, particularly with regard to text i/o by voice, keyboard, or swipe-typing. I even bought a roll up keyboard to avoid the horrible Gboard experience, but you can't haul something like that around most of the time -- and it was pretty awful, too, for that matter.)

I had a minor, but fairly negative experience with Apple software back in the 1990s. Then someone had me try to straighten out their Mac Powerbook laptop. Oh, my gosh, what a DOG. Anyhow... when I'd find myself thinking dire thoughts about Android, I'd remind myself I'd sworn to never give Apple another dollar.

Android,awesomeaviator,0,"Tests need to make sure that they use Night Sight with the Pixel, even in the day to capture maximum dynamic range. My Pixel 3a has almost no issues with clipped whites with high dynamic range shots if I use Night Sight.

Google's processing, other than the issue with stray hair due to the lack of a depth sensor, is nothing short of incredible. As a photographer, none of the competitors produce colours that I'd be happy with. While my Pixel 3a does tend to lean cold in terms of white balance, this is easily fixed and colours still look fantastic. Samsung is a particularly bad offender with processing, with terrible skin smoothing and awful colours. The Pixel also offers the ability to shoot raw natively , with a very neutral screen for easy editing on the go. 


I do agree that it's time for Google to use new hardware. Larger sensors, a better ultrawide, a telephoto lens as well as depth sensing will ensure that they stay ahead.

I will say that the Apple Pencil is *incredible* compared to the S-Pen though.

I'm also happy with the always on display, it's useful to see what apps you have received notifications from. I was a little reluctant to go with the G5 because of the bootlooping issues and build quality issues, but it's hard to ignore it considering the price now. All the phones at around the $400 US price point have some sort of compromise. The G5 is the first I found that is the most complete package for me.

I pay 60€ per year for the hosting, the domain and unlimited email inboxes.

Android,Rebelde80,319,"This is hands down the best phone I've owned. I started the year with an S7 Edge. I enjoyed the phone, but I didn't like the curved screen. I also found the edge panels gimmicky. There's nothing the panels did for me that I couldn't do with a good rom and/or launcher. I swapped it out for the regular S7, but I grew bored of it. I hadn't realized how much I'd miss not rooting a phone. So I used an upgrade and got an LG G5. I really, really liked the camera and interchangeable battery. Like, a lot. But the QC was awful. I went through 4 phones and they all had horrendous back light bleeding. I returned that phone and finally ended up with the HTC 10. I'm having so much fun with this phone. The developer community seems strong, and there are plenty of great roms to flash. That's how I gage how good a phone is for me: by how much more I use my phone and how much fun I have with it. The S7 and S7 Edge were fine, but I simply wasn't as excited about them as I am about my HTC 10. I'm definitely not a fan boy. I don't think one phone is intrinsically better than another.

But for me a Samsung could never be the best phone for me. For what I want.. the HTC 10 kills the S7. 

I love this phone.",5,positive,"Main object: Android

Sentiment: Positive",positive
Android,JonF1,1475,"In general I think the HTC 10 is the best phone that I ever owned.

I know compared to the S7 that it doesn't do a lot or have a lot of features. It lacks wireless charging. There's no water resistance. There aren't all of the bells of whistles of Touchwiz such as multiwindow. 

However, what the phone has is done is done really well. There are no real major weak spots that the phone hardware has.

The overall phone design and build quality is excellent. One major plus that it has over the S7 is USB C which gets rid of the guesswork of Micro USB and its much more reliable. The phone's back side is curved which improves ergonomics, but no so much that you get the phone dancing around when being used against a table like the Nexus 6. Something that new users might find weird is that the home ""button"" is capacitive and not a physical button like on the S7. Also, the two volume buttons are placed above the power button, which will take time to get used to. Honestly my only complaint about the design is the camera bump, but the HTC 10 is far from the only victim here.

Moving on to the screen, I think it gets too much hate for not being AMOLED. I miss the true black of AMOLED phones but the contrast levels on the HTC 10 are great, and there is no backlight bleed. The 10 includes options to tweak the color gamut from a wide and vibrant setting to a more color accurate sRGB one as well. There is also a slider that lets you choose whether if you want a warm or cold display. Honeslty my only complaints about the screen is that its hard to use in direct sunlight and that the color temperature slide doesn't really let you choose a truly cold temperature, but just a less warm one. Its a very small nit pick but eh.

If you are an audiophile or you invest in high quality headphones, then this phone is a must for you. The HTC 10's DAC and amplifier are both strong and clean. If you were thinking about getting an external dac/amp like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Headphone-Amplifier-Integrated-Smartphones/dp/B00J2JATL0) than consider the HTC 10 because you wont need to buy that if you get the 10. If you are coming from a phone that has dual front facing speakers, prepare to be disappointed, however. The speaker quality is a cut above average but it just lacks direction. The speakerphone uses the tweeter in the front of the screen but the woofer/squawker is at the bottom of the phone, like the iPhone.",7,positive,"Main object: HTC 10

Actually my wife's Moto X is why I got an iPhone. Like a lot of you, I think, I went from smaller screens to bigger ones. I had an HTC One M8 when my wife got her Moto X, and I remember thinking I could not go back to a smaller screen, but the 4.7"" screen on the Moto X was just perfect. My previous phone to the M8 was the Galaxy S3, also a great size at 4.8"".

Of course, I got a 128GB iPhone — no way would 16GB ever have been enough for me. My M8 was 32GB, but I had a 64GB memory card in it.

On a more serious and relevant note, what did the Moto X offer that the Pixel line doesn't? Aside from that cool twist to camera motion gesture, which Motorola used in later phones as well. Wife's next phone, the Droid Turbo 2, added a karate-chop for flashlight that worked just as well. If Pixel had the motion gestures, they would have everything of value Moto X brought to the table.

Android,gamera8id,876,"It's a great tablet.

I pre-ordered the Korean LTE version off eBay to get a working Phone app in an attempt to reduce to a single device.

Around the house I primarily make calls using the speakerphone. Outside the house, calls and notifications were handled using the combination of Galaxy Buds bluetooth headphones and a Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch.

Most of the time I could accomplish the tasks I needed with it in the book case in tablet mode. During work hours, Dex using an external touchscreen monitor, Bluetooth keyboard, and wireless mouse worked great. Rarely, when I needed a laptop, I propped it up with the book case and attached the pogo pin keyboard from the flawed keyboard case (with Dex also.) TBH the 10"" screen was just too small for me.

This setup fell down for me because of the camera. I have no complaints about the tablet's camera hardware, but I found myself wishing for a camera in my pocket too often while on hikes when digging a tablet out of a backpack wasn't feasible.

Before abandoning the tablet as my single device solution I tried pairing it with a Palm phone (awful battery life plus couldn't use tablet LTE to make calls -- also no longer single device), a Sony DSC-QX10 bluetooth lens camera (just...no), and a GoPro. The GoPro worked the best, but was still no match for the convenience of a smartphone camera.

I'm now attempting a Note 10+ as my single device. It seems to be better suited to the approach.

I use the same desktop setup when I need it.

I have a Nexdock Touch pre-ordered for use as a laptop.

I'm hopeful, but what I'd really prefer is Dex on PC to work with a Chromebook as I've also tried the Pixelbook and Pixel Slate.

Other than specialty items (like the tablet with working Phone app and the lapdock) I've been very successful at obtaining the hardware I've used second-hand through sites like Craigslist and eBay.

Android,jcbsera,9188,"Android's ideology has always been: be together, not the same. We should celebrate diversity and choice. Android was never about having the best of the best, but having what you needed with what you could afford. || Lately, I've noticed there has been so much tribalism. There's always someone out there ready to put someone else down because of their choice in phone. I'm getting so tired of the constant:

*""iPhone, oh welcome to your expensive walled garden. I would never be so stupid to pay $1000 for a phone.""*

*""OnePlus is from Oppo. That's from China. It's shit.""*

*""Google has really bad support. Avoid like the plague.""*

*""The amount of pre-installed and un-installable apps on Samsung makes me want to kill myself.""*

*""Folding phone? Ain't nobody going to pay for that at $1500 when I can buy a great phone that can perform just as well for like $300.""*

*""Sony makes phones?""*

While some of these points might be valid, we have come so far in terms of developments in smartphones over the past decade that the industry itself as a whole has grown so much more than what we expected it in the 2010s. A lot of these don't really matter, yet so many people are in the camp of ""maximalism"". There's often a need to shit on others just to feel better about one's phone as it is the ""best"" available out right now, or that their operating system is so much better than the other because this feature ""existed already for the past 4 years"".

I feel like it's time we get past that. I could use a Galaxy S and you can use a Pixel. We both understand the shortcomings of each, and **that's totally fine**. Equally, we both could know a guy that uses a WhateverPhone Z cause that's all they can afford and **that's fine too.** There shouldn't be a need to shit on anyone just because you have the most expensive phone out there and they don't.

I feel the tribalism is just hindering the community as a whole. Strange, one-off experiments usually lead to improvements and shouldn't be laughed at because they drive the industry forward. Differing platforms may be implementing stuff that we've already had for years, but them implementing it should be a success story since it means our influence is far-reaching. People who are less fortunate than us shouldn't be looked down on because they have less, but embraced as we can be together as part of the same ecosystem that accepts whoever-the-fuck, rich or poor.

Celebrate that we're together, leave discrimination at the door.

Be together, not the same.

Android,cdegallo,6860,"I happily go between google and samsung phones--most recently an S23 ultra and an 8 pro.  I really like the 8 pro.  But from the perspective of samsung software additions, when used to using those features in your everyday life, it is always noticeable when you don't have them.

Samsung device integration is really good, samsung did a nice job in this regard.  We incidentally had a samsung TV and wireless dex--which I personally didn't use much--was so seamless it was impressive.

I also agree re. the brightness slider--though I don't find the need to adjust brightness that much--having it at the bottom of the tray, like what samsung has done, is a better-attention to general UI ergonomics--no need to reach up to the top.

The other thing that I like from Samsung's UI is one-handed mode where the full UI can be shrunken down and accessible--I like this more than google's bringing down the top half of the UI.

As for the pixel 8 specific stuff--I haven't so much as seen any generative AI stuff, whether it's processed on-device or not--in my everyday use.  I do like the ""Best shot"" feature in google photos because it's always been difficult to get a perfect family photo with my spastic son.  But as we've seen with other of google's advanced editing features, it wouldn't surprise me if this eventually gets pushed to google one subscribers, like what they've done with their other ""seemingly pixel exclusive"" features like magic eraser.

Simple things like consistent quick toggle behaviour, easy to set up automations, useful add-ons like edge panels and even actual fast charging are things still missing from the Pixel lineup, as well as an ecosystem outside of mobile devices.

Android,mub,3248,"You got me intrigued, and as along time user of Firefox on Android I thought I would compare it to the Samsung browser. FYI I'm on a Oneplus 3 running 7.1.1

I grabbed the latest version of Samsung Internet and opened the last 10 sites I had viewed in Firefox.

The load times were not noticeably different for each page but I when comparex the smoothness there is no doubt the Samsung browser is much smoother, impressively do in fact. However, looking closer I noticed I can scroll a lot further in a single swipe using Firefox than in the Samsung browser, and scrolling in the Samsung browser fells like there is some sort of resistance. I think this reveals the trick. Firefox tries to respond to the input instantly and then goes as fast as it can, whereas the Samsung browser has a tiny delay in the acceleration that gives the app a chance to load things first and makes it feel slightly sluggish in comparison.

So in my own, admittedly limited, testing it seems smoothness comes from a trick in presentation. Scrolling in Firefox is fast but rough, in the Samsung browser it is very smooth but slower.

I am going to live with the Samsung Browser for a while and then go back to Firefox and see it helps me decide which I like better.

Android,HaMMeReD,5345,"2 Things here

a) Browser Apps != Standard Apps. They are much heavier then people really think. They definitely could optimize more.

b) Android Scrolling has improved significantly over the years and is a high priority for google. Even the difference between a 2013 and 2016 class device is massive.

The main problem is that ListView typically was really good at firing off your Garbage Collection which can cause performance irregularities, especially on older android devices. (The UI thread would pause to collect, causing visual stutter). 

The GC has also been updated to be much more performant and not cause ""hiccups"" anymore, but it can still impact hitting a 60fps target.

However, hitting 60fps (on a modern device) isn't that difficult. You just need to be smart about how you write your program. Standard advice, don't do long running stuff in UI thread, lazy load where possible in other threads, never put network on the ui (this will preventitively crash nowadays).

Additionally, if you enable developer mode you can change animation scale which should impact most apps as well, if they use Androids animation frameworks.",2,neutral,"Main object: Android

Which may be true but the reason why I think is important and under discussed. Some recent updates by Samsung have made me realize this.

I find it frustrating to get updates as the rational for the update is often times not clearly explained. The often times just add more bloat than they do useful features as manufacturers try to force feed you things they've decided are most recently aligned to their goals.

With updates being anywhere from duds to frustratingly adding apps and software you don't want I can see why most users wouldn't care for, or actively avoid installing updates.

If manufacturers wanted people to install updates, take part in new system versions, and use more of their proprietary apps they need to do a lot better at contextualizing updates, explaining their benefits, and if you don't like the supposed new benefits of additional software's let you more easily opt out.

As an anecdote I'll go through what I've experienced with Samsung in the last week or two...
 
---

In the late spring or early summer I purchased a Samsung A50 from a reseller. I had a V30+ which I really liked and was still functioning relatively well but I wanted to try something new, and a crack in it's screen was getting worse.

I liked the A50. It had some bloatware but it was easily uninstalled or disabled pretty quickly. No worse than setting up Windows or some other operating systems for the first time. Certainly better than some Android phones I've had over the years which felt like progress in the right direction.

The last week or so has been a frustrating mess from Samsung though.

First even knowing I had suppressed Samsung Pay as much as possible and had not thought of it since I got the phone a weird white bar appeared at the bottom of my home screen.

[Swipe up to find it's a Samsung Pay shortcut they've inserted.](https://imgur.com/a/RX5FRLA)

Which I never turned on or asked for as I don't use Samsung Pay. Trying to give some credence to maybe myself being dumb and having pressed something or a pocket dial incident of sorts I tried to nuke the app back to the Stone Age. Uninstall all updates, disabled notifications, disallow all permissions, ect.

Swipe up is still present. I finally cave and update it to try and disable it (after reinstalling the most recent updates) from within the app. However the only way to reach the setting screen where you can reportedly disable this is by [accepting the terms of service, and then signing into either your Samsung account or 'Sign In With Google'.](https://imgur.com/a/AahXh6G)

You cannot see that you have to create an account until after you accept the agreements either.

A few days after being annoyed by this but giving up fighting it for the time being it has since disappeared. Which makes me wonder if it's some A/B test, or poor quality control in what's enabled or disabled as a part of background updates.

Additionally they processed a system update with [a long list of changes a day or two after this.](https://i.imgur.com/ylwEIXN.jpg)

[This update either added, or re-enabled two new apps.](https://imgur.com/a/EQHD7dY) AR Zone, and ""Tips."" Neither of which can be removed or disabled. AR Zone can be ""hidden from the app list"" which is now another contextual menu buried within the app settings away from the place you traditionally disable an app you don't wish to use.

Neither of these apps are mentioned anywhere in the change log of new software they show you after update. No explanation of what they are, or what they do, and they aren't easily hidden away or removed. They just exists and are in the way now.

---

In the end from a user experience perspective this is all very poor and I can see why it would drive people away from upgrading or wanting to upgrade software. I understand why companies want to push their latest and greatest services, why A/B testing is beneficial but that has to be more carefully balanced.

If there is no relenting on the end of developers and manufacturers with how aggressively they shove this stuff down your throat either through background updates that make it look like ghost did it, visible updates with bad patch notes, or just poor QA control where the update brings back things you previously disabled it doesn't do a lot to make users trust that updates can be interesting, beneficial, or practical in their day to day lives.",1697,negative,"Main object: Android

Android,OtherTechnician,326,"TL:DR  It's all about the money.

&#x200B;

Apple has ,what? Maybe 6-10 phones they have to worry about providing software for - all of which they control 100% of the configuration, software, manufacturing, and experience. That doesn't sound that tough to me. Android phones are legion, Android 'manufacturers' are also pretty numerous. It's a whole different magnitude of problem.

Now, lets briefly look at the financial incentives. Apple pretty much owns the revenue stream. They can charge pretty much whatever they want and command lucrative deals with carriers and resellers eager to dip a bucket in the Apple river of money. Android has maybe 2-3 companies that are making any real money. Google has a built-in advantage by owning the platform and essentially forcing Android OEMs to sell devices that provide a continuing revenue stream for Google while they have to make their money on the initial sale and any bloatware deals they can add into the phone. Samsung has an additional hardware revenue stream by providing chips for some of the other OEMs, but so far all attempts to create a Samsung platform to compete with the Google Play platform hasn't taken off. They keep trying tho. The other Android OEMs are flailing.

Updates next. There has been an ongoing hue and cry about Android ""fragmentation"". This is because the OEMs have very limited ways in which they can differentiate their products with them all based on the same open source version of Android (AOSP). This begat the OEM 'skins' that so many have come to love. Samsung has been the most ambitious at skinning their phones and have added a lot of special features and flourishes. This level of customization requires significant work effort to incorporate changes in AOSP while maintaining the extensive custom skins and features. The financial problem this causes is that there is no way to recoup the cost of making these upgrades except by adding more special deals or services like Samsung Pay. Samsung gained the reputation of being the slowest OEM to update to newer releases of Android. Lately they have caught up and in some instances moved ahead of the pack. This is partially due to changes Google has made (Project Treble?) to isolate the layers of the OS to make it a bit easier to work with the new versions. Google has gone so far as to basically shift to an annual release schedule for Android and only do monthly Security patches - we all want our phones to be secure, right? With the Pixel line, Google has gone to quarterly 'feature drops' to ease their own development burden. OEMS may or may not get these 'features' in a subsequent AOSP release. 

Now people are complaining that Google will only support their phones for a fixed number of years while Apple supports theirs for a longer period. Well, Google is subject to the willingness of the chip suppliers to provide driver support over time as well as the same issue of committing development resources to old phones. Android OEMs generally do not make any money when a phone has its software updated - who would pay for an update after all these years of 'free' updates?

Until such time as the manufacturers can better 'monetize' the OS update process, it will be a process driven by competing needs and wants. The users want their phone to work and have all the new bells and whistles and be secure. But they don't want to pay for it. The manufacturers need to get what they can on the initial sale and try to figure way to continue to generate enough revenue to support devices over time, Apple has a captive user base and don't really care about anything except maintaining their market share.  Google has a recurring revenue stream based on hundreds of millions of Android devices - they don't really care either, except to protect that Platform services lock in. They would like to be Apple in this market. Samsung wants to be both Apple and Google.",78,neutral,"1. Main object: The main objects of the post are Apple's iOS and Android.

I understand that with the S6 Active and S7 Active, they were niche devices with niche functionalities, but you can't just remove features and expect people to trust your updates when they buy a new phone. Also, with the S9 and One UI, I understand the need to make elements larger and promote one handed usage, but make it so the text displayed is also bigger or have the text display more content per element.

The idea that you'll need to maintain your phones (delete all unused, unwanted apps, clear up temp files etc.) or that a software update can improves the phone never occurs to these group of users. They buy a phone, use it a year or two, (to them) phone gets old, they buy a new one. I have a friend who keep buying phone with larger capacity simply because photos are never managed or stored to cloud: buy a new phone, move all old files to new phone, take more pictures, phone is full, buy another bigger phone.

And admittedly, even Google (and to some extent, Apple) or whoever, did bring bugs with updates. Not very often, but it happens. And to this group of users, that's one more reason not fiddle with upgrades. When it gets older or ""worn out"", buy a new one. 

Manufacturers need to do a better job educating users that keeping phones updated is a good practice. They should make new updates more reliable. But obviously, the motive to do so is not high. Yeah, there are reviewers or tech savvy who would praise that an upgrade improves their phones but if they have the same amount of effort (and resources behind), they would rather focus that on developing a new phone (results in more sales). 

This brings me to an idea: what if, it becomes a norm to charge for software upgrades? What if manufacturers can make a good amount of money out of selling upgrades. They invest in R&D and programming etc., but no need to invest in hardware development/production/logistics. Will that provide enough motive to work on high quality software upgrades?

An Otterbox conmuter makes my phone indestructible and comes in whatever colors I want. It also preserves resale value so I can buy a new Samsung phone every year.

The reason Samsung was, for a long time, the top Android manufacturer was because they differentiated. Removable battery was huge. Having a spare battery always in a charger was amazing. Go to Miami and use phone at the beach all day. Go to room and switch battery and go party. All friends iPhones are at no battery by 10pm and I'm still snapping pics and hailing ubers. 

Expandable storage is awesome because I keep apps on the phone and put my data on the card. Every year when I get a new phone I swap the memory card out and boom...I've moved into the new phone.

They didn't listen to the huge bezel concerns and the phone is still too large being nearly the same height as the LG G3 except with a screen considerably smaller and that's still a huge issue to me (That being said I didn't expect a completely new build quality this year). Other than that they did fix a lot of the issues I didn't like with the HTC M8 (Button placement) although the initial impressions of the camera are quite worrying to say the least.

The HTC Fans got hyped on the rumored and rendered pictures then got disappointed they didn't get a new build design this year which is pretty unreasonable given the cost associated with doing so. Other than that HTC pretty much improved upon the HTC M8 in every other way (Assuming the Camera holds).

Galaxy S6:

-To be honest I'm not a huge fan of the new design materials. The design itself looks really nice, but I don't like that they used Glass for the back of the device which tends to be really fragile.

-The lack of a Micro-SD Slot is a huge disappointment. I can't find much reason why they needed to remove it since the metal HTC One phones still have them implemented.

Android,CannedBullet,23981,"M9: A better camera with OIS and better button placement would be nice. If you ask me they should change it where the microSD slot is on the same side of the phone as the SIM slot and put the power button where the microSD slot used to be. 

But that would mean the engineering team would have to redo the packaging for the internals. I know a lot of people don't want the HTC logo bezel and wanted a look closer to the M9 concept that won us over, but the display drivers need to be somewhere. Also because of how aluminum interferes with electromagnetic radiation the radios (the things that make it a phone) need to be put somewhere too.

So unless HTC starts making plastic flagship phones (which would cause an outcry form the Android community) or wrap the sides of their phones in plastic, the logo bezel will stay.

Overall, I wouldn't be surprised if HTC plans to follow an iPhone style system where they have a fresh redesign one year, iteration the next, fresh design, iteration, etc. Honestly though, its not worth upgrading to an M9 if you already have an M8.

Android,mrinsane19,40116,"HTC has produced some really good looking phones year on year, particularly with the m7 and evolution of that style into the m8. There's a style they have, but each phone looks unique. I am one of the few that actually liked the ultra pixel stuff too. 

The m9 doesn't have the same degree of separation from the previous model as the rest, you'd really struggle to pick the two apart if you weren't a HTC nerd. While the new cam is better outdoors, it's also junk indoors which is where I use mine more. And no ois, again. All in all the camera is no better for me and it looks basically identical. Why upgrade from an m8? (bear in mind my argument is pretty much invalid if coming from anything other than an m8).

Htc has thrown out some very nice designs this last year in the desire series... So to see the m8 recycled was just sad. 

Now to Samsung. Hardware is easily the best going around. Could use a bigger battery but I'm sure it'll be fine. 2600 in the m8 does me plenty. Big gripe is as much as it has awesome hardware it's going to have average software. It's always been a limiting factor on Samsung and while it's getting better ""project zero"" didn't go anywhere near far enough. Couldn't care less about removable bits. As long as I have 32gb one way or another I'm happy. Even the styling has improved enough that it's not embarrassing to own one. 

Back to software, it's bad, and being Exynos (which from a performance perspective this year is a good thing) it's going to be a very rough ride with CM, so stock/molded stock roms are all you really have.

We're not all the same and that's what creates new ideas and innovations. Personally, I see pros and cons with the S6. I can't speak much for HTC because I don't really use their products.

Pros: headphone jack below works great when you're using headphones with the phone right side up, the speaker at the bottom is great because it will no longer be muffled by the phone when it is on a table or something and it faces towards the listener better, looks more premium than the older models, better camera, better fingerprint sensor, better screen, and better specs.


Cons: glass back is another thing to break, no microSD slot, no removable battery, not water resistant, and doesn't have USB 3.0.

Lots of pros are expected because it is supposed to be an upgrade from the S5. The glass back is gorilla glass, but that doesn't mean it won't break. I had the nexus 4 and that also had heat problems with the back glass. I actually use my microSD slot for more memory, but wouldn't really need it if the phone had more space, which the S6 does. Even if i didn't use it, it would be nice to have in case. I know people that have to have multiple batteries because they use their phone a lot. Also, if the battery ever fails, it's only a ~$15 fix instead of ~$50+. I haven't really ever had to replace my battery in my phone, but it would be nice for emergencies to just pop in another battery. It's not water resistant, but I wouldn't bring my phone in the water even if it was. It's a nice feature to have for accidents or if you want to take water videos and pictures. I love USB 3.0 because it is much faster, but I will still survive with 2.0. I never transfer much data anyway.

Overall, I think this S6 is a very nice phone. I'm not sure it's worth the upgrade from an S5, but it definitely would be for anything order. I'm glad they didn't make the phone bigger. It's actually slimmer and lighter than the S5. I'm using an S4 right now and want to upgrade, but the price tag is really high. I think people that need an upgrade, but don't have a lot of money to spend on a phone could look at the S5. It'll be much cheaper when the S6 launches.

About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM/YTM/YT Premium, etc.  

---------------------------------

The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.

I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. 

- One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from ""YouTube Music"".

- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.

---------------------------------

But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. 

Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:

- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps

- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship ""killers"", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support

- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add ""powered by Android"" on their bootscreens](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy

- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features

- **Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because ""Android 10.1"" is being released as ""Android 11"". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)

- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone

- **Google is still a ""faceless"" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as ""being used in a way that violates Google's policies"" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has ""done so."" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time

- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located

- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)

- Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriers

So I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very ""self-service""/""you're on your own"". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is /r/Android, and Android is supposed to be a ""platter"" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).

Does anyone else feel similar?

Ah, that explains it. You're in an echo chamber. AP in recent years seems to have recognized they get a lot more traffic when they post things that get people on this sub angry. One of their newer writers published an article where they said it was ""trivial"" to reverse a hash of a SMS message and when I pointed out hashes are by definition hard to reverse they got all defensive and insisted they were well educated on cryptography. Their most recent batch of writers are enthusiasts who don't seem to ever look deeper into the actual technical details and eagerly publish things that make mountains out of molehills without including the greater context.

I'd encourage you to step outside of AP and this sub and ask someone that isn't an enthusiast about these things and I'd bet a lot are completely outside their realm of concern. Android started out catering to mostly to enthusiasts like us and that made it less appealing to the vast majority of the rest of users. Now that they have tried to strike a balance, some enthusiasts are upset that the needs of their minority are not being prioritized. And I get that, when you're used to being catered to, any less of that feels like being ignored, but I think it's important to look at the bigger picture.

You also don't seem to recognize the reason OEMs are able to put out features before Google is because they don't need to worry about the platform as a whole. For example, the reason the Google Recorder app [doesn't work on some phones](https://www.xda-developers.com/download-latest-google-recorder-app-android/) from Asus, Oppo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi is because they modified TextView, a fundamental part of how text is displayed on Android:

>Android software without significant modifications to the TextView component in the Android framework. It seems that the Google Recorder app fails to work properly on certain devices because those devices are running software with modifications to TextView. 

I'm sure whatever changes they made to TextView were important for their flavor of Android, but because they didn't care about interoperability with the platform as a whole, it results in these side effects. Then people get mad at Google for not letting any phone download this app when it's not really their fault it breaks on some phones and allowing them to download it anyway would make them look bad.

Similarly, Google doesn't have control over how OEMs price their devices so I'm not sure why you brought that up as something they've failed at. If anything, they've made efforts to make sure more affordable devices still can have good experiences with the lightweight and offline-ready Go apps and take advantage of encryption even with [SoCs without hardware AES acceleration with Adiantum](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-adiantum-encryption-for.html). They also released the Pixel #a series to show people it's possible to be affordable but still high quality. Now there are rumors OnePlus is following suit and getting back to their roots of affordable but quality. It's possible those two things are unrelated, but it's equally possible they saw the response to the 3a and wanted a piece of that pie.

You point out the backup solution as being insufficient and compare to Titanium, but as someone who just had a phone die on them, the existing backup and restore worked for the vast majority of what I needed it to do. The single thing I wished it had was backup up previously paired BT devices but that was hardly a major inconvenience. Most everything else password autofill or Smart Lock did the trick. I used to use Titanium, it was by no means flawless and without issues and restoring backups across major versions of Android sometimes broke things.

I understand you personally want a means to download an entire dump of your phone to your computer like Titanium did, but I'd wager the average Android user has no desire for such a hands-on method and that a lot of iOS users just use the iCloud backup nowadays. The criticism I've most seen is that Apple makes all apps backup their data to iCloud but Android allows devs to opt-out, but you also have to keep in mind iCloud comes with 5GB of storage by default so that can fill up quick with app data and photos and incentivise people to pay for more. Noteworthy, [Google doesn't count the 25MB of data per app against your Drive quota](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html#BackupLocation). Plus devs can have valid reasons to opt-out like if the apps stores sensitive data. Removing that choice like Apple does doesn't seem like a good move to me. Additionally, Google has continued to make improvements with [enabling device-to-device backups by default](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-force-app-local-backup-restore-handicap-cloud-backup/) and [Block Store so that when upgrading or replacing a phone apps won't even need to be manually logged into again](https://9to5google.com/2020/06/15/android-one-tap-passwords/).

Project Treble and Mainline are examples of Google ""\[doing\] something impactful about it"" so why did you not mention those? We've already seen [Android 10 adoption rates](https://www.extremetech.com/mobile/300738-google-says-project-treble-has-massively-accelerated-android-updates) and Samsung reap the benefits of Treble. [Samsung got 10 out in 3.5 months when it took 6 to get 9 out the door](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/samsung-ships-android-10-in-the-us-s10-users-on-t-mobile-sprint-get-update/). As more phones ship with Treble and Mainline this benefit will grow. Regardless Google's size or value, they can't exactly force Qualcomm to continue to provide updated drivers. What leverage do they have? ""Hey, if you don't do this, we're gonna stop using your chips in our phones (and please don't read the rumors we're already exploring that)."" The rest of the OEMs of the world surely aren't going to follow suit.

Regarding RCS, Google doesn't have total control over that, The GSM Association does, so it could be they're waiting for the standard to be fully fleshed out before rolling out the Android API for it. They have every reason to want that to be available so if they're holding off it's likely there is a reason. Also [3 years ago they got all these OEMs to include Android Messages by default](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14721602/android-messages-google-rcs-universal-profile) as the included SMS app so it's not like everyone needs to install it:

>LG, Motorola, Sony, HTC, ZTE, Micromax, Nokia, Archos, BQ, Cherry Mobile, Condor, Fly, General Mobile, Lanix, LeEco, Lava, Kyocera, MyPhone, QMobile, Symphony and Wiko, along with Pixel and Android One devices.

Similarly, when carriers were dragging their feet on the rollout, they decided to step around them and use their own RCS backend to give users access regardless their carrier in the US and the UK.

I must admit, complaining about version numbers is pretty silly to me. What difference does it really make if the next version is Android 11 or Android 10.1? Do you really think users outside of this sub understand what 10.1 even implies? Plus, Google uses [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so if there are non backwards compatible API changes in the next version, it goes against that to call it a 10.1 update. Just because Android is more mature than it used to be and version updates don't include all the new bells and whistles you expect doesn't mean 11 should instead be 10.1.

By all means they need to do better by developers caught up in their automated reviews, but if they just said ""here's exactly why you got banned"" then malicious developers could use that to work around those restrictions. It's not nearly as cut and dry as you make it out to be and that lower barrier for entry means the scale of devs and [apps they have to deal with is greater](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/):

Android,Bossman1086,247881,"I'm with you. I used to be a pretty big Google fanboy back in the day. But not only have I grown tired of them abandoning some of their best products I was still using, but there's also the issue of their Android support and other things I don't like about how the company is run.

In the last 2 years or so, I've tried to move away from Google services as much as I can. I use a combination of Brave and FireFox on desktop and mobile now for my browser. DuckDuckGo is my default search engine everywhere (only go back to Google when searching for specific things that DDG isn't quite as good at). There's no good alternatives for YouTube, Android Auto, or Maps so I'm still using those (Waze is owned by Google). I moved from Google Music to Spotify. And I bought my own domain name and purchased a small business Microsoft 365 subscription that lets me use the domain for email. The Outlook android app is fantastic. And I still use my Gmail account for a lot of log ins and contact info, but I've been slowly moving things over.

The nice thing about Android is that it makes it easy to do all that. I can use any service I want and Google can't stop me. It's harder to do that with iOS, for example.

I burned through at least 20 phones in the last 1-2 years and decided this month that I will switch to Apple's iPhone.

Sure, iOS has it's downsides but I look for a phone that gets long update support and that is where Apple shines. 4+ years of updates no matter of your location or provider is just a blast. Smartphones become more expensive and I'm not willing to buy a $800+ phones only to replace it 2 years later and sadly most budget friendly phones get rarely updated and also dropped after 1 year.

Flashing a custom rom is since 2017/2018 not possible for me anymore. All my finance apps check for root/bootloader and even sometimes ROM version. There are some patches that can be used to bypass those checks but if apps get updates you have to wait till a new workaround will be published.

They are doing so many things, but they should enforce some policies which OEMs have to follow so that the end experience will be a better one. 

Now that the price of the flagship phones have crossed 1000$, it is unfair to have just 2 years or even 3 years updates. Phones will keep on working for more years, just because of lack of updates, users will be forced to switch. 
I have also heard from different people who have moved from Android to iOS, that even some Google apps are better on iOS. I don't know whether it's true, but if it's true, it is so disappointing. iPhone chips are also consistently faster than Snapdragon now. There are still so many reasons to stick to Android now.

Android,neuprotron,3552,"Long term Galaxy Tab S6 review: The best Android tablet that is awfully underrated || Last year, I was in the market for a new tablet. Since I was already in the Android/Samsung ecosystem, and my girlfriend already has the iPad Pro, I took the bullet and bought the Galaxy Tab S6. Here is my in-depth review after using it for about 8 months:

# Display

This is the highlight of this device. I will say it: The **Galaxy Tab S6 has the best looking \~10"" display you can get on any device today**. It's vivid, contrasty, bright, and has excellent viewing angles. The main advantage is the fact that it's a large version of the AMOLED panel used on Samsung's flagship phones. I have the new MacBook Pro 13"", iPad Pro and a Galaxy S10 to compare, and I can't think of a better device to watch movies or play games than the Tab S6. It doesn't have the 120hz refresh rate of the iPad Pro, but for my use case of watching Netflix, reading eBooks, and playing some popular games (CoD Mobile, PUBG, Asphalt), all of which fall under 60fps, this 60hz AMOLED display wins over a 120hz LCD display. For more latency-sensitive use like drawing, and playing certain games, then the iPad Pro has an advantage. Worth mentioning that the Tab S7 that's right around the corner, will likely have 120hz support as well.

# Speaker

The Tab S6 comes with a quad-speaker set up. It's loud, clear, and balanced. It's better than my (gf's) iPad Pro (2019) and almost as good as my MacBook Pro 13 speaker (which is regarded as having one of the best speakers for a laptop). Listening to music, watching movies or gaming is quite enjoyable on these. The speaker also seems to change its audio profile/direction depending on your screen rotation dynamically.

# Design

The design is premium and sturdy. The design on the Tab S6 is as good as it can get for a modern tablet. I do wish they had an IP rating, but that's something the iPad Pro also lacks. The S-Pen sticks to the back of the tablet. At first, I thought this was weird, especially if you are going to lay down your tablet flat. However, pretty much any case which would flatten the bump and makes it look like the S-Pen is in a tiny hidden pocket. I think some even might prefer this over the iPad Pro approach (which adds extra width).

# Battery

The battery lasts all day of continuous usage. Standby time has been pretty good for me as well, even after leaving it on standby for some days. Overall, I have no complaints in this department.

# Performance

This is one of the smoothest/fastest devices I've used, even after 8 months. The old days of Samsung's laggy software are long gone. The Tab S6 handles everything you throw at it with a breeze. Games, multi-tasking, and just general usage are lag-free and fast. It comes with the latest UFS 3.0 storage which is an upgrade over the UFS 2.1 on the S10. One UI 2 update even brought some nice animations changes. 

# Software

You would think Samsung would slap on their One UI that's on their phones and be done with it, but Samsung did add small but noticeable tablet-specific optimizations and features here and there. The S-Pen and Samsung Dex integration are well done. You can use Samsung Dex straight from your tablet without having to use a second monitor, which is pretty cool. I also really like the new gesture system on One UI 2.1. I no longer have to reach all the way to the bottom just to go back. Overall, I like the software. The system layouts are pretty intuitive and optimized for a tablet. Speaking of layouts...

# App scaling

I've been pretty surprised by how well Android apps work on devices with varying screen sizes. I can't think of any app where I thought the layout was bothering me. I guess if Android apps work well on ChromeOS, foldables, and Samsung Dex, they should work fine on a tablet.

Some Google apps like YouTube, many Samsung apps like Samsung Internet and My Files have some tablet optimizations. By tablet optimizations, I mean letting you see a bit more content at once. I think they are a nice touch, but I don't think they are an absolute necessity on Android since Android already handles app scaling pretty well.

Apps without tablet optimizations work way better than they do on an iPad. Instagram, for example, has massive letterboxing on an iPad. [Whereas on an Android, it's full screen.](https://mobile.twitter.com/daniel_scuteri/status/1265102390782382080) Some might argue Android is just ""enlarging"" the app, but I would say most people would prefer that over a miniature version of the app. Plus, most Android apps make use of the larger screen real estate by displaying more content (for example, more songs on Spotify and more emails at once on Tab S6 vs. S20).

# S-Pen

These are just bigger versions of the S-Pen on the Note series, which are pretty good. Compared to the iPad Pro, the latency could be better, but that's more of a display refresh rate issue.

The biggest problem is the lack of apps that make use of the pen. Some apps like Dropbox Paper have excellent iPad pencil support but no Android pen support. I've found Samsung Notes to be the best at note-taking when it comes to the S-Pen support. Hopefully, more widespread adoption of the Galaxy Note/Fold 2 series will help drive more S-Pen support in apps.

# Main gripes

* Slow updates. I got the Android 10 One UI 2 update a month ago, May 2020. That's pretty late to the party. Some parts of the world got it months earlier but the US got it last. The One UI 2 on S10 was released late Nov 2019, which makes you wonder why it took so long. Security updates are also slow. I get security updates every three months, but my S10 gets them monthly? I am not sure why there's a vast discrepancy in update speed between Samsung's devices. Likely the issue is a mix of long QA testing, limited resources, and carriers taking their time.
* Fingerprint scanner. In the past, the FP scanner had 60% success rate. Nowadays, on the newer version of the software, I think it's pretty good at a \~85% success rate. Still could be better, but these optical fp scanners are surprisingly more accurate to wet, sweaty fingers than the old capacitive fp scanners.
* Camera. It's acceptable. It's a single 12MP camera that is not as good as the S10's camera. I've tried GCAM ports on it, and they do seem to improve picture quality. Tablets have always had weaker cameras than phones, and this is not an exception.
* Poor thermal management when charging. If I'm playing a graphically intensive game while charging, the frame-rate drops 10 minutes in. My S10 does not do this, even though they have the same SoC, and the tablet has a larger surface area for heat dissipation. I guess that the Tab S6 lacks the liquid cooling of the S10 and/or the system doesn't correctly slow its charging speed under load.

# Final thoughts

The Tab S6 is a surprisingly good premium android tablet that does many things right. Every time I use this device, I can't help but think it deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. A lot of popular tech reviewers seem to overlook this tablet entirely. The Tab S6 is without a doubt an expensive tablet, but if you are someone who is strictly looking for the best Android tablet, or the best 10"" entertainment device, I think this tablet should be #1 on your list.

When people say android tablets are terrible, they clearly haven't used this one. It's the iPad of the android tablet world IMO. I just bought a 7th Gen iPad 10.2 and it's great too, but I don't feel that the Tab S6 is any harder to use or any worse at all. Dex is fantastic too. Standby time is ridiculous on it too - mines been on for well over a week and has barely dropped 20%.

Android,Unknown,0,"I've been using it for a while now and its a good tablet. Best I've used, though I haven't used that many before. Previous one was a S2 (but I think its the previous gen of that).

In any case I love the performance, the screen, the weight, the size and the overall quality (software and hardware). I didn't really like the keyboard, been rocking the normal book cover for it. I also prefer using it as a cover instead of the keyboard which is too heavy. I can use the book cover with the keyboard cover too (don't use that one either) so I can just plug the keyboard on when I need it but thats 1% of the time.

The only downside I found was the brightness. Outside with nice weather its just too dark for me to use it normally. I would've liked more brightness there, but the rest of the time its amazing and its not impossible to do stuff outside, you just have to set things away from dark-mode to get enough contrast. Its fine imo. Could be better.

The rest is fine. Something I might be annoyed with in the future is lack of updates, but I already know I could put another ROM on there, so its not a major issue either. I'm fine with how it is and not really miss anything.

The camara is not the best, buts its pretty good for scanning Documents etc. I still hate, that the camaras are the biggest selling point of every smartphone. I dont care, I dont need it and I dont want to pay for this. If I want to take photos, I would use a Canon or something.

Thermal management: I had no problems at all while charging and gaming or anything. Yes its gets warmer, but well good under the critical line. Its not the fault of the SOC, its the Battery itself with over 7000 Milliamps.

1. The Samsung browser. Actually, any Samsung apps that have a Google analog... Don't you lose the benefit of the ecosystem by not sticking with Google? Browser syncing across devices, Keep and Calendar integration, etc.? I've been a stock Android guy for so long that I haven't had to consider these issues. 

2. Does your tablet freeze up much? I find that Chrome especially locks up fairly often, eventually throwing the ""wait or close"" window at me. 

3. The S pen. I've never had one before. I actually like it a lot for browsing in bed because I can navigate regardless of my position without having to reach a much. It's just more comfortable. But what are the more ""power"" uses of it? I tried using it to start and stop video capture from about 10ft away and it was kind of spotty.

""I think we knew this was coming. All flagships are adopting this type of  feature. The question is whether it's implemented well. I don't want a  night to day mode like on the P3. Which was basically turning even the  darkest shot into the brightest shot, with orange/yellowish tint. I want  something more like Mate20Pros where it takes an actual darker shot,  makes it clearer and obtain better detail. Yes it's impressive software  regardless, but I think a night mode shouldn't try to make a image super  bright. It should capture better detail in otherwise darker shots where  you'd normally lose the detail.""

Thankfully I didn't edit these comments. Should I be mad at this lol? I'm sure I'm not the only guy he's done this to, I mean I find it kind of funny but still.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

I just noticed at 1:19 he stole my same comment from yesterday about my prediction for the real prices on the S10 models. Lol.

**EDIT 2:**

Those that pointed this out in the comment section on his video, I appreciate it!

**EDIT 3:**

His email is in his about section on YouTube for ""business enquiries"", in case he decides he will start buying comments instead. You guys can maybe pitch him something and sell him your comments!

**EDIT 4:**

Damage control. He deleted the older video, and a lot of comments have been deleted calling him out.

**EDIT 5:**

Sal has commented on one of the comments I left in the video addressing it and has apologized to me. Seems this effected his channel in some way. Not sure how I feel about it, but while most in my opinion would ignore the issue entirely, he at least apologized for it. A video apology would of been better or if he didn't partake in damage control, but I'll take it . I'd like to point out I originally found this to be funny, but at the same time believed it needed exposure as I feel it's an on going issue. Hopefully this encourages Sal and other channels to push out more original content or to at least credit sources.

Linked image of apology:

[https://imgur.com/a/kdNhXT1](https://imgur.com/a/kdNhXT1)

**EDIT 6:**

Sal has Opted to delete the newest video/comments as well for further damage control, taking back his public apology considering when it was said. I feared he would do this and was actually thinking he'd do the right thing. Sal we know you will still be seeing this post so I want to say to you, not cool Sal. Not cool. Also continuing to delete comments on your videos, and blocking people on twitter is not helping the situation. People are now gonna know your channel is more full of shit than ever.

**TechTalkTv**, I now know you're only sorry because you got caught.

**EDIT 7:**

Sal is denying this was damage control and spinning it as he deleted it because he was receiving racist comments, some others in his comments section were saying people were saying racist things as well ( I can't say what happened during the time of 3am-11am, but before and after I saw no such racist comments, not giving him the benefit of the doubt considering he was deleting comments immediately, and thereafter). As someone who has monitored his channel comments and this subs comments, I saw no such comments and at this point he's spinning his own wheels and playing victim. Sal, we know why you were deleting comments, we know why you blocked followers on twitter, we know why you deleted the videos, and we know why your apology is meaningless given the time it was said, and where it was said.

[https://imgur.com/a/8wqff5y](https://imgur.com/a/8wqff5y)

**EDIT 8:**

This is purely just speculation, but their was a person commenting in the comments section on TechTalkTv's channel with the name ""S R"" defending Sal, and I think one of the only 2-3 people defending him also using the talking point that people were saying racist things. I called him out on it and asked him when was their a racist comment, and he deflected then deleted all his comments. Note: He only deleted his comments after I had immediately said his channel was sketchy. To me this is pretty suspect, that he would use the same talking point as Sal, and then delete the comments after he was called out on it. If I didn't know any better, I'd say Sal made separate channels to rush to his defense and pretend to be someone else. But again this is just speculation.

Android,RedPenguinGB,9820,"My experience moving from iOS to Android. || Hey everyone,

I'm writing a post I wish me from a few months ago could read to save myself a lot of time and a lot of searching. I used to be an avid Apple user for a good few years up until their various anti right-to-repair moves and their OSes became stale, boring, and restrictive (although for the last one, they have been like that for a while now). So my adventure started and I tried out a Z Fold 4 (wasn't for me, I never used the inner screen yet had constant anxiety about killing it), a Pixel 7 Pro (was very close to staying but the battery life was terrible, it had major heat issues, and was disappointing outer casing wise), and ended up on the S23 Ultra. I moved from an iPhone 14 Pro Max and wanted to find the perfect Android (having found the perfect windows pc and linux laptop).

The good:

* S23U battery life is comparable if not identical to the 14 Pro Max for my use. That was one of my biggest concerns and after the Fold and Pixel, I'm happy to find something that actually lasts me a whole day very comfortably. No battery anxiety!
* Every Android phone I've tried felt smoother than Apple's offerings. It might be their implementation of the refresh rate and animation speed but Android feels faster and snappier. Scrolling is near instant, closing and opening apps just flies by and everything is very satisfying overall.
* Wow, the cameras. S23U camera (sensors) are better than iPhone 14 Pro Max for me. It's as simple as that. Pixel was also very solid but the disappointing front facing camera threw me off. ZFold4 was very meh. (There will be more about this).
* Freedom! It finally feels like I actually own the phone instead of renting it for an outrageous one-off price. I can use a web browser that isn't Safari in a trenchcoat, install a youtube app that skips sponsor sections and doesn't show me ads, and overall do anything. I can finally use all the power a mobile CPU is giving me. It doesn't feel like a smarter phone, it feels like a computer in my pocket.
* Customisation. I very strongly dislike the stock Samsung experience. Goodlock, custom launchers, keyboards etc gave me the tools needed to get it to a point where I want it to be. After setting it up, nothing comes close.
* There's a bunch of stuff I forgot like actually usable widgets etc. There's a bunch of QOL improvements that are very significant to me and its disappointing that supposedly the best option on the market doesn't have them (I'm looking at you Apple).
* Double SIM card slot! For someone who's not in their home country, being able to have a local and foreign SIM inside is a godsend. Not everyone has eSIMs.
* Reverse wireless charging. I'm sticking with airpods and it's nice to be able to charge them on the go without any cables if I forget to do so at home.
* Under display fingerprint sensor, we still wear masks sometimes here.

The bad:

* The camera (implementation). Samsung's processing is just plain terrible. It oversharpens and oversaturates everything and when you turn it off, photos look worse. Even turning on photo softening in Camera Assistant didn't fix most of it. I downloaded a GCam port and configured it a bit further and am getting close to DSLR-quality results. I am so incredibly impressed by what these cameras can do and kind of questioning why Samsung butchers them. Fortunately enough, this can be solved. That's why I love Android, if you have a problem, there are resources to solve it.
* Google really really needs to reevaluate their Google Play policies. Some apps are very undercooked and underpolished and shouldn't be let onto the google play store before being fixed. For example: apps not using the raw camera api and just taking screenshots of the viewfinder, apps not using UI elements from the latest OS versions (there are some apps still using some elements from Android I've seen on old HTC phones!!).
* It is kind of disappointing that I had to set up my phone for 10 hours to get it to this amazing to use point but I guess that's what Android is. I suppose it's personal preference though because with the Pixel I didn't run into this issue. Once again, I appreciate that I at least had the choice to do that.
* Oh my god Samsung, I don't want Samsung pass and all the other random shit you've installed on my phone. Thank you universal android debloater for existing.
* No Apple Watch and AirTags. It's what I signed up for and I'm looking into a replacement for the Apple Watch but with AirTags, nothing comes close.

Are you an imposter ? 

Regardless. Good write up. 

For the watch, I suggest galaxy watch or ticwatch or Garmin watches (if you like expensive shit) if you are want 3-4 weeks of battery life and dont care about android watch apps then try watches from amazfit. 

For a airtag replacement well I guess you are in imessage land ? So I dont think so there is anything close to that. But if you are not from imessage land and are in EU then the Samsung tags work pretty well. One my mates has it and it was able to find stuff as accurately as airtags. 
Also even tile is a great option! I personally used them and it worked great. 

As for any Samsung bloat apps. Fuck them! Debloater tool is so good and comes to the rescue here. 

Also if you want watch movies or read manga or anything like that, android has great 🏴‍☠️ apps for them. And also android has many other cool apps which makes life easier and its also fun to tinker with.

""Jimmyispromo"" is a great content for Samsung stuff and other superb tips and tricks ""Saki tech"" is also a great source for stuff. Again these two youtuber specifically focus on Samsung stuff and Samsung tips and tricks.

Extra tips :- 

1. Use nova launcher, icon packs, kwgt widgets along with wallpaper packs to make your phone your own.  [Just want to clairfy that nova although being bought by branch. 

The last stable app version and the last beta version hasn't been updated after branch takeover. 

So you can still atleast install the stable version of nova and face no issues. 

Just disable auto update for it. ]

2. You can try an alt open source store like f-droid. You can install droidify (a f-droid store) and install all the repo and use tones of cool open source app. For eg - warpinator, seal, mj PDF reader, mull, fairmail etc.

3. Disable Samsung shit, because Samsung collects a shit amount of data. Even in EU they do it a lot even with gdpr. 

4. Check your google account settings and disable location and other stuff so that it doesn't personalize your data. 

Maybe keep some stuff active like for maps and YouTube if that is something you use. Disable for everything else in the google account setting.",124,neutral,"Main object: Android

I wonder if this is partly due to it being different rather than necessarily better? Because as someone who's exclusively used Android for the last 10 years, every time I've seen iOS in action I've thought, ""damn, they have the UI smoothness locked down"" - IMO only the Pixels come close.

Lack of control and customaztion is the big one. I watch youtube all the time, so I need revanced. Ad blocking, play audio in background, sponsorskip. With iOS, you are left with using a web browser. Side loading or jailbreaking is a hassle and ruins your ability to get iOS updates. Lack of general file explorer is annoying.

I have a low end Samsung. There are some good things and some very bad things about it. (It has a very hinky Wi-Fi, three times slower than my old Moto, measured multiple times; often does not auto-reconnect. A terrible step downward.) But the processor seems to be well up to the job, core performance is strong.  (But after trying to get the Wi-Fi fixed by Samsung three times, I've firmly decided to never buy another; my love for my desktop Samsung monitor notwithstanding.)

A *lot* of things about Google's stewardship of Android have bothered me in recent years. (I've been on the OS over a number of phones since 2012; I started out really liking it after moving from a Blackberry I had really liked when I changed carriers. Unfortunately, in recent years, the relationship has frayed considerably, particularly with regard to text i/o by voice, keyboard, or swipe-typing. I even bought a roll up keyboard to avoid the horrible Gboard experience, but you can't haul something like that around most of the time -- and it was pretty awful, too, for that matter.)

I had a minor, but fairly negative experience with Apple software back in the 1990s. Then someone had me try to straighten out their Mac Powerbook laptop. Oh, my gosh, what a DOG.

I played with my sister's iphone 7 and realized that i could live with ios. It was the iphone's hardware that turned me off. 

-Their obsession with thinness that made battery capacity small. 
The smaller iphone has 1900+ mah battery. In android, that capacity would be a joke of a phone but due to ios's optimizations, it can go toe to toe with the smaller android flagships. Now imagine if Apple made a small but thicker iphone to accommodate a large battery. 

Screen  
Apple is using ips lcd. If they switched to amoled, battery life would be better no question about it.

Second, their a10 chip already blows every android chipset out of the water so i do not know why they stuck with hd and full hd resolution. The small phone should be full hd and the big phone should be quad hd.

Huge chins
Again a major turnoff but it might be killed in the future

Selfie camera and microphone
For some reason, samsung's older s7 has a wider selfie camera than the newer iphone 7 and the mic sounds more muffled than on the galaxy s7. 

Again, I'm asking if apple solved these shortcomings, would you be tempted to switch?

Android manufacturers tend to throw every resource they have on hardware but if google/android is the problem itself then what would improve in the years that follow?  

Sorry for the long post, I needed to bring this out because I am really dissatisfied with Google's direction. Their executives act like nerds who go all out with an invention but then get bored and move on to the next great thing. They have bad after sales support  and they also set a bad example of how long a device gets updates. If the Pixel itself would only get two years of major software updates and a few more months of security updates, why would Samsung or any other manufacturer do anything differently?



EDIT: I didn't realize this post would blow up so much! I've been reading through the comments. I think the majority sees no problem with apple's hardware. ios is the main gripe of android users and yes, I completely forgot about the shitty file management and notifications system of ios because i was just using a borrowed phone. I'll have to do more pros and cons comparison. I intend to wait it out with my trusty galaxy s7 for at least 2 more years. I hope a revolution comes by then.

Yes, I sympathise with that. I love my 5s (yes, yes, I know it's old, but I really like small screen phones), but I still prefer my Moto G 2014 over my 5s. Here are my reasons why: 

1. iOS used to be the king of quality apps, but I think that has changed in the past few years. Sure, most apps and games are first released on iOS, but the thing is that after the introduction of Material Design on Android, the quality and feel of apps has changed leaps and bounds. We have better designed productivity apps, and we also have better Reddit apps than iOS – something I found really surprising when I made the switch to the iPhone last year. 

2. iPhones have great stand by time! I can go into class at 8:30 am with 100% battery and come out at 1 pm with 99% battery. That's phenomenal! Sure, Android has Doze and Doze OTG, but they never really seem to work as well as iPhone's standby time. But, Android devices have better SoTs, and I'd take that any day over better standby time. I don't get why Apple have to design thin phones. Sure, there might have been a need for it when the Nokia 5800 and the Nokia N8 were bulky smartphones, but that time has come to pass surely? 

3. Very limited OS. I have enjoyed sideloading eBooks and whatnot on my Android devices and then opening them in an app I prefer to use. But on iOS, while I can sideload files into certain apps, I can hardly use those same files on other apps. Or share them to other devices for that matter. Have an interesting PDF or ePUB to send? Well, you'll have to wait until you get to your MacBook so you can share that over email or whatever to a friend. I would like it if iOS would grant access to the file system so that we could at least have control over what we put in our phones. Oh, and do you want to sideload movies? Well, best of luck doing that if you don't want to open your MacBook (or PC), load up iTunes (a nightmare for anyone), and then transfer it over. No SSH access or whatever until you jailbreak. What a bummer. 

> Android manufacturers tend to throw every resource they have on hardware but if google/android is the problem itself then what would improve in the years that follow?

More than Google/Android, it's the OEM skins that are the problem. Sure, they add value, but that's at the cost of performance. Not everybody has money (or want to spend that much even if they do) to buy flagships, and skins take a major hit on performance on mid range phones like the Redmi series or Huawei's Honor phones. I'm not a stock ""shill"" – I love MIUI very much, but putting it over Android? I don't think that's the solution.

The focus on smaller and smaller bezels is about to become as useless as Apple's fixation on making everything thinner and lighter.

My primary pain point with iOS is the inability to set default apps.  Specifically, I'd want to do this for Email, Calendar, Browser, and Maps at the very least.  My business runs on G Suite, and I don't want to feel like I'm swimming against the tide while I'm trying to get work done.

The rest of the issues are mostly minor gripes, but they add up.  Things like the control center being stupidly designed (at least for me, and my uses) and inflexible.  Notifications need an overhaul.  App settings are a bit of a mess.  

If MacOS were suddenly inflexible as iOS, I'd reluctantly have to switch to Windows.  On the other hand, if iOS were suddenly as flexible as MacOS, I'd buy an iPhone today and be thankful that I don't have to rely on Join anymore.",8,negative,"Main object: iOS

Android,sk17,1267,"Pixel 6 Pro vs. Samsung S21 Ultra (Snapdragon) Actual Comparison || Alright, I've been comparing the two side by side for about a day now and there are some GLARING differences that I have not heard mentioned or seen in reviews. I don't know how it's possible since if you compare side by side it's incredibly obvious, but here we go:

To set the stage, I've owned every Pixel since the 2 except for the 5. Have owned OP 7Pro and S21 Ultra the last few years in between and was extremely excited about Google finally making a flagship. Sadly, I think they fell short (except for the cameras.)

&#x200B;

* Display
   * This isn't even close. The S21 Ultra's display is much brighter and clearer than the P6 Pros. When I watched a 1440p side by side video on YouTube the S21s 1/4 brightness is the P6s 3/4 brightness. Not to mention the video just looked better
   * You really have to dial up the brightness on the P6. At 50% brightness it looks like it is still in dim mode.
   * No way to change between HD, FHD or QHD on P6. How is this possible?
* Fingerprint sensor
   * I don't know how more people aren't shaming Google for putting in an optical sensor rather than ultrasonic. The speed of the ultrasonic on the S21 and being able to unlock the phone even when the phone is completely locked and the screen is blank is fantastic. On P6, you have to tap to wake, then literally push your finger down on the phone while a giant flashlight scans your finger to unlock it much slower than S21. At night when in bed, this is an issue if my partner is trying to sleep and there is constantly a flashlight turning on and off when I need to unlock my phone. This is almost unforgivable, IMO
   * No option to turn off unlock animation, not even in developer options. Can turn it off on S21 easily.
   * Speaking of unlocking, no face unlock on P6. Oye.
* General performance
   * I've seen speed tests where both phones are neck and neck. I'm not sure how because every task I have done side by side, the S21 loads faster and feels faster. Buffering on YouTube is almost non-existent when you are skipping ahead whereas every time you do that on P6 it buffers and has to load for a quick second.
* Power button placement above the volume rocker on P6.
   * How did this get approval in the first design stages?! It's a little thing that is such an easy fix but now it's in an awkward, not easy to use place, since your finger rests where the volume keys are.
* Gyroscope on the P6 is very slow.
   * Going into landscape mode on anything has a 1 - 2 second delay where the S21s is almost instant
* Cameras
   * P6 Photos look great, but I don't think it's because of the new sensor yet. They look very similar to old P5 photos in good conditions
   * Night photos look better if you don't turn on night-sight on P6
   * Video is pretty equal between both. This is where Google has probably noticeably progressed the most
   * The ultra-wide on P6 can barely be called that. Not sure why they chose such a narrow sensor when using all new hardware.
* Battery
   * I'll need to keep using P6 to see how the adaptive battery works but out of the box it is sad to see that even with Google Tensor there seems to be a lack of optimization.
* Stock Android 12 vs. Samsung One UI Beta (Android 12) - I like the design of stock Android but some simple functionality hinders it and makes simple tasks annoying.
   * Wi-fi toggle...are you kidding me, Google? Sometimes I wonder if you actually test your phones or just throw stuff in there half-baked
   * Volume toggle - on P6, you have to click the volume rocker, click the sound profile button and then select if you want it to be on silent, vibrate or volume on. On Samsung, you pull down the task bar and click through which one you want. So much better.
   * Brightness control - you have to swipe down twice on stock Android where it's already there on Samsung and at the bottom of the phone now
   * No double tap to sleep on P6. This has been around on my LG phone from like 7 years ago, what are you waiting for Google?
   * At-a-glance on P6 - Google, how can you not let me turn this off on my homescreen?? I want to use another Google widget I love instead but this never leaves the top left corner.
   * Google search bar on homescreen on P6 - Isn't it about time Google let us take this out and use more of the homescreen for what we want?
   * No quick shortcuts on lockscreen of P6. Two on S21 in bottom corners.
   * Google, stop making us install 3rd party launchers to fix your poor design choices. If you haven't noticed, the people who buy and support Pixels are techies who love as many options as possible. Maybe this is the point to appeal to the masses, but you haven't earned that hardware business model yet. ;)
   * Why can't we build folders in the app drawer on P6 to make things all nice and clean?
* Final thoughts
   * Tensor seems to be more marketing than anything at this point, except for a couple of handy tools like speech recognition and magic eraser (which I'm sure will come to Google Photos at some point and be widely available.)
   * Google makes great strides and then they completely blowout a hammy in the last quarter mile of a race with really bad mistakes on design, functionality, etc. Who beta tests these phones, honestly?
   * P6 Pro will continue to get better and better as more updates come out, I'm sure. But Google really needs to pay more attention to what competition is doing and understanding what people really like in other Android skins. I'm not sure if it's stubbornness or honest oversight but they have to get better.
   * Isn't it time Google got on a better calendar cycle when releasing hardware? Now with Tensor they shouldn't be constrained. Stop releasing at the end of the year and get in the game with Samsung! S22 will probably be EVEN faster than the S21 already is and that's only 3-4 months away!
   * They call it the Pixel 6 Pro but feels like there is room for a Pixel 6 Pro Plus. The pricing is great for these phones but I'd gladly pay a little more to not have to deal with obvious shortcomings that are easily solvable by better hardware.
   * Samsung has come incredibly far with One UI. It's like they actually listen to customers and offer a pretty close to stock experience while only adding beneficial tweaks and software improvements. If Samsung stopped preloading their own homegrown apps like Galaxy Store, Bixby, Samsung Internet, Samsung Cloud, etc. and let people make their own choices, it would be hard to ever chose Pixel over Samsung at this point, IMO.
   * Google, if you want a beta tester. Please let me know. :)

Edit: Not being able to remove the arrow in the bottom left on GBoard on Pixel is extremely annoying. Samsung lets you hide that but I can't find anything that says stock Android lets you. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Edit 2: You can't turn off 5g connection if you are using Google Fi. 🤦

Edit 3: I realized that I'm running the beta of One UI. Need to compare stable version when it's released but Samsung is still flying comparing to P6.

Edit 4: For people giving Google a pass on going optical instead of ultrasonic, here's what S21 is capable of.

Edit 5: Can't use Brave browser. Seems like it's not supported yet.

Sentiment: Neutral",neutral
Android,Powerful444,395,"Display brightness - the pixel is graded differently so 1/4 on the pixel doesn't equal 1/4 on the samsung.  They appear fairly similar max brightness so this is just a presentation difference. Samsung is probably a tad brighter at the max but the pixel certainly can get bright.

Youtube buffering - no difference on mine

youtube quality - yes i can see the s21 ultra is a tad sharper and has more hdr.  It does look a bit better but the pixel looks good too.

fingerprint sensor - yes agreed

Power button above the volume has always been that way on pixels.  You are just used to samsung.

gyroscope - mine appear the same speed

ultrawide - a lot of people are getting on to google about the narrower field of view.  Personally I don't like ultrawides being too wide.  The pixel one has less distortion and is a bit sharper without the artifical sharpening taken into account of the samsung. I'd take that over a super super wide angle. 

cameras - I use gcam on my s21 ultra and photos are pretty comparable.  The 4x cam on the pixel is really good ... when it kicks in.  I hate how there is no option to keep it selected when light isn't optimal.  I will tell you when I want to digital zoom the main cam.  The super res zoom is pretty decent so google beats the samsung in the mid zoom range.  The 3x zoom on the samsung is really good though as well as the 10x being fun to use.  The main cam has more natural bokeh which I like on the samsung.  

I am finding that the optimization on the pixel camera has some way to go.  The pixel 5 I have takes better standard photos in my opinion getting the white balance and colors more accurately.  When lights go lower the 6 pro wins as well as with zoom of course.  And video is better on the 6 pro.  But I was expecting more main cam improvements rather than to my eye a slight step back in consistency.  There is a bit more natural bokeh but not as much as I expected.  And the pixel 6 tends to over expose too often in an attempt to brighten things up. 

Stock android 12 is not to my taste.  So I will agree strongly here.

Tensor - I think you missed out some of the benefits such as the transciption and other AI things that the chip is meant to be targeted towards.  It won't be a pure speed demon - the samsung will always win that kind of race.

Weight - the pixel is evenly balanced whereas the s21 ultra is a bit too heavy and top heavy at that.  It makes it harder to use.  Both are big phones but the pixel is easier to handle.  Though it is a slippery thing.

The s21 u has the spen as well of course.  Wish it was integrated though.  Will be looking forward what the s22 ultra will bring in a couple of months.

Android,amorphis89,446,"Interesting how different our takes on a few things are - having tested the Exynos S21U side by side over the past few days, I feel the P6P is an upgrade in most areas. Maybe Exynos/Snapdragon equality still isn't a thing?

_x000D_

* S21U's camera is amazing in good lighting, but was otherwise very inconsistent for me. P6P gets the shot right far more often for me, regardless of lighting. 10x digital on the P6P actually looks significantly better than the S21U's 10x optical in average lighting. I do prefer the ultrawide and it's macro on the S21U though._x000D_
* P6P's speakers are better, both in-call and media. They're fuller sounding and surprisingly give the impression of bass in music.
* P6P's haptics are bit of an improvement. Not huge. Google's use of them in the UI also helps - so maybe Samsung can work on that one to even it out a bit._x000D_
* S21U was always fast and snappy, but there were often graphical slowdowns bringing the framerate down below the 120. P6P (so far) is much more fluid.
* Screens are on par. S21U is definitely brighter, but I have no issues with the P6P in the sun.Fingerprint reader is definitely quicker on the S21U, though I have had no accuracy issues on the P6P._x000D_
* P6P consistently benchmarks higher for me, up until it starts thermal throttling in stress tests etc. In 3DMark stress test the P6P starts off with a higher fps and holds it until about 1/2 way through the 20 pass test, before it tapers down to below the the S21U's fps, and becomes unstable. S21U on the other hand starts off lower, then by about 1/4 way through drops and maintains that fps. I recall the S21U having the same huge drop & instability as the P6P before the updates so I think Google will fix this._x000D_
* I had no real issues with OneUI, and I haven't tested OneUI 4.0 yet so don't know what Samsung have improved - but I do prefer the Pixel's UI experience with exception to the quick toggles. The extra customisation from Good Lock was really nice - I miss a few things they added._x000D_
* Battery for me is a reasonably significant improvement too. Typical work day I have about 25% battery extra left. This may change as things settle in, but positive impression so far.",18,positive,"Main object: Comparison between Samsung S21U (Android) and Pixel 6 Pro (Android)

Android,Hawaiianhippie,5868,"iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, Note 8...a poor man's review || I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  

X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...

The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. 
What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.

FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. 

However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.

Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...

Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the ""I hate Samsung"" train that is r/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying ""it's sooo smooth!""  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.

The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   

Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious ""Pure Android"" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. 

A noteworthy experience, but can it last?

My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g̶i̶m̶m̶i̶c̶k̶ feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. 

Picasso once said ""Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun."" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but ""THE"" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, ""Smooth now, but give it a month or two..."" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. 

What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. 

Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it’s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I’m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don’t kill off the headphone jack. 

Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

There's also a bit of a grain on the screen that I can see if I bring the phone close enough to my face.

I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why.

The battery life on the Note8 is astounding imo! I easily make it through a 10 hour work day with plenty of battery life to spare and thats with LTE on.

Android,Unknown,0,"Thank you for this review, I feel like this is the one that should've shown up in my Google searches a month ago when I was debating the same thing after becoming eligible for an upgrade. People need to see this giant wall of text before going flagship shopping on black Friday.

For me, going from an iPhone 6 Plus (not even S, it was two years old) to now having a pixel 2 (I went smaller to both save money and avoid the screen issues), I can say I do not regret this one bit.

I found all the things you said about the XL ring true for my phone as well, and I'm happy with the ecosystem I ended up choosing. I think I would feel the same no matter what flagship I ended up with, but I'm glad that all their strengths and weaknesses can be compared in a review like this.

Android,neuprotron,3552,"The ultimate list of Galaxy S11 predictions and their probability of happening || The Galaxy S11 is around the corner and will most likely be here in 4-5 months. I did the research so you don't have to. Here are the best predictions as of right now.

* **(Very High probability) Big increase in camera sensor size and quality.** Think of the sensors used on Huawei's flagship phones, but with better photo and video processing. The S11 might become the camera king of 2020, especially if Samsung ends up using their custom sensor that's not attainable by other OEMs. It will result in much better low light performance and better HDR with less noise. [Source 1](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1178602226186473472) [Source 2](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1176348666178621440)
* **(Very High probability) 3x - 5x optical lens.** Also a very likely update, along with an additional camera feature. Earlier this year Samsung [bought](https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-corephotonics-purchase-947109/) the same firm that developed Oppo's periscope camera. Samsung already has it developed this [year](http://www.etnews.com/20190520000215?mc=em_006_00001). Ice universe further confirms a new optical lens: [Source](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1181201410559336448)
* **(Very High probability) 90hz - 120hz display.** This is pretty much given considering most Android flagships are using 90hz. Even Ice Universe says it's very certain. [Source](https://twitter.com/firre1337/status/1184262789445095424)
* **(High probability) Faster updates.** This is not Samsung specific, but will probably benefit Samsung the most. With Android 10, Project Mainline fundamentally changes how non-major updates work. Most phones shipping with Android 10 will get updates through the Play Store, rather than carriers. [Source](https://www.androidcentral.com/project-mainline)
* **(High probability) New M10 OLED.** Most flagships in 2019 including the iPhone 11 use Samsung’s M9 OLED. The S11 is rumored to use the next-generation M10 OLED. [Source](https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1166723432760762368?lang=en)
* **(Some probability) New Exynos architecture** Samsung ditches their Mongoose architecture, and will use ARM's new A77 design combined with Samsung's 7nm EUV process. [Source 1](https://wccftech.com/exynos-9830-cortex-a77-galaxy-s11/) [Source 2](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1178964831480639489)
* **(Some probability) Taller phone.** S11 is rumored to have a 20:9 display. It could mean smaller top/bottom bezels and longer phone. [Source](https://www.sammobile.com/news/benchmark-listing-hints-taller-display-on-the-galaxy-s11/)
* **(Some probability) Lack of buttons.** Samsung has been rumored to curve their displays more and replace the physical buttons with customizable haptics. It was a canceled feature on the Note10 but could debut on the S11. [Source 1](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/20/rumor-galaxy-note-10-wont-have-headphone-jack-or-volume-and-power-keys/) [Source 2](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1174159095953145856)
* **(Low Probability)** Spectrometer sensor - Detects the physical makeup of an object. [Source](https://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-s11-may-be-first-samsung-with-spectrometer-30593387/)
* **(Low probability) Samsung GPU.** Samsung has been working with AMD Radeon for its own GPU solution. There is a slight chance this could appear on the S11. [Source](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/4/18651894/amd-radeon-samsung-graphics-soc-chipset-exynos-smartphones)
* **(Possible but pending evidence) All Exynos devices.** One of the main reasons why Samsung uses Snapdragon chipsets in the US is because they support the CDMA network which Verizon and Sprint use. However, by the start of 2020, CDMA will be mostly phased out in the US with Verizon ending its support on [January 1st, 2020](https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/knowledge-base-218813/).

Android,doejinn,64,"HTC were well known as the best smartphone maker in the windows mobile 5/6 era. Tech savvy smartphone users knew they made quality products. Early adoptors of android of course went with HTC, they didn't need to be advertised to, HTC had a proven track record in the smartphone space that couldn't be matched by Samsung. That, and the partnership with Google for the g1 meant HTC did very well in the early days despite being relatively unknown by the mainstream.
    
Samsung, however, was a household name. Back in 2005-2010 HD TVs were reaching ubiquity due to the fall in price and Samsung was arguably the most well known manufacturer. You have to remember the times here, HDTVs were cool, samsung was cool, samsung TVs were better, they had deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios. Samsung was (and is) a household name. So when the mainstream came round to adopting android they had a choice between HTC, an unrecognised brand which was making so many similar phones that it just confused the customer, and Samsung, a name synonymous with technology. It didn't hurt that the s2 was absolutely lauded with praise at the time. Much more than the s3, the s2 started the snowball rolling for samsung, with even tech savvy smartphone users ditching HTCs for it.

What happens next is predictable. Samsung has a huge marketing budget and HTC doesn't. That and the herd like qualities of the mainstream means HTC was lost in the dust. 

On a personal note, and I don't know how much of this is true for others but the smartphone batterylife is atrocious for people who have basically replaced their PCs with their phones. It makes so much more sense to just swap the battery out. Samsung has been IMO very sensible about that and the SD card is always expandable.

Android,agentxq49,211,"Sorry if this is a late post, it might be buried but i'll post it anyways.

I had been following the two brands when they were breaking the market.

My opinion has always been that Samsung made a winner with the Galaxy S2. It was released months before HTC released their S2 competitor, the Desire HD. At that time, the android space had only one competitor which was the Iphone.

The S2 was the successor to the Nexus S, and their Galaxy S. It had everything to be successful, removable battery, expandable storage and AMOLED display for battery performance. It was light and cheap as compared to the late-to-the-party Desire HD. The Desire HD was heavy, solidly built phone, and had great hardware to go with it.

What changed the game, in my opinion, was the developer community. The S had a huge number of developers, putting CM on it, and removing touchwiz, optimizing the software much faster than the Desire HD developers, where the main one i remember clearly was Android Revolution HD roms. Even as a DHD user, i recommended the S to my friends, saying it was lighter and much faster, and even kept myself up to date to the custom rom community. The S gained a lot of ground for Samsung, even when they released the Samsung Galaxy Mini, Ace etc, while the DHD was followed by the Salsa, Wildfire S, Desire S, Jetstream etc.

Samsung spent a lot of money on marketing now. They captured the tech geeks by releasing the S2, and are gaining momentum on the iphone users who were getting bored with their phones. Marketing and timing came together, with Android 4.0, the S3 was the android phone, while HTC was flirting with their Facebook phones and their Sensation XL, which i could never get over the fact that it had a removable back, that exposed everything on the front as well. The Sensation XL did not gain the popularity with everyone like the S2, and this was the turning point for both companies, even when they were trading blow for blow with each other.

The next generation was the nail in the coffin. The One X was a good phone, but not the android phone being marketed everywhere. They had one thing over the S3, which was the Tegra processor. the Tegra processor was beating the S4 processor in the S3 in nearly every way. But no one cared for the processors except for the tech geeks; the same ones who recommended the S2 to all their friends over the Desire and Sensation lines.

The S3 took off, and it was a self fueling machine, where everyone was talking about an android phone as the samsung s3. No one was talking about the One X, the Beats audio (which audiophiles loathe), and HTC's unveiling party was just mediocre compared to Samsung's with that huge LED display across the stage.

And that was that. Samsung also took a chance with the Galaxy Note, beating the Dell Streak in terms of success, thanks to their impeccable combination of sense of timing and opportunity, knowing that momentum was to be ridden on from the past generation by going from S to S2 to S3 and now the S4. The Note, Note 2 and Note 3 were just the icing on the cake. Compare this to the Desire, Desire HD, Sensation XL, Butterfly S, One X and One... even i had trouble keeping up with HTC's flagships.

TL;DR, The S2 won the Sensation in a crucial time, allowing for a huge Dev community to capture the hearts of geeks everywhere, who via word of mouth, recommended the S2 to everyone who wanted an android phone at that time. Samsung went on to market the S3 as THE android phone, and had a lucky break with the Note series. Samsung was logical, riding on their success by naming their phone S to S4, Note to Note 3, while HTC did themselves no favor, especially after losing the S2 battle with their Sensation XL, heading back to ground zero going from Desire to Desire HD to Sensation XL to One X to Butterfly S to One.


*This is from my experience locally in South East Asia, and is my opinion and mine alone. i don't work for any of the companies, and i own the HTC Desire HD (my favourite phone), the Note 1, a GNex and now a Nexus 5.

Android,crackinthewall,1149,"They put their money where their mouth is? I got good support from Samsung and given that I'm in a third world country, that's a big plus that they're not ignoring us in favor of bigger markets. We have service centers in most major cities so if something goes wrong with our Samsung phones, they're easy to reach and they're very easy to talk to. Replacing electronics is something only Apple does in this country but Samsung's repair is quite fast. If they tell you, you'll get it back in two weeks, you'll probably have it back in a week's time. Compare that with Nokia, which used to hold the mobile phone market here or HTC which have only ONE service center manned by incompetent buffoons. If I'm going to buy a premium device, I would expect premium service and sadly, HTC doesn't seem to want to provide that where I live.


The lowly Galaxy Y was still receiving updates last month, when was the last time the One V was updated? And that's just for maintenance updates, not Android updates. Everyone made a lot of noise about HTC streamlining their product line with the One series but that went down quite well with them releasing more than a dozen phones across the One line, the Desire line and the Butterfly. The One S, which was their 2012 midrange, was stuck in 4.1 while their 2012 flagship is still on 4.2. We can all praise how fast HTC updates the HTC One now but who knows what will happen once their 2014 flagship is released. HTC has always been faster in releasing updates but long term support has not been their forte in years.


Sense may look good and it may have historically ran well for flagship phones but that doesn't mean anything if their lower end phones runs like shit. The One V and the Wildfire were barely usable as phones but those cheap Samsung phones with laggy TW can at least be used properly as phones for texting and calling. 


If Samsung handled the SII (i9100) the same way all their competitors handled their 2011 flagships (stopped at ICS, blamed the chipset makers, etc), HTC might have had a bigger market share now. They used to be Android royalty but starting with Sense 2.x, they got in way over their head. Sense became bloated with animations, the Desire almost never got GB, they released the Sensation with average internals, etc. By the time they realised their mistake, Samsung has gotten too big. 2013 was the year they tried to undo the mistakes they made in the last three years but it won't be enough. Samsung needs to spectacularly fail if HTC wants the top spot again and even then, they'll be competing with Sony and LG for the crown.",2,negative,"Main object: Samsung

Android,Gearsper29,1,"Why android is losing marketshare || So every few months we are seeing articles that android is constantly losing marketshare. That young people and in general people how want a high end phone and can afford it overwhelmingly prefer iphones.

In the comments under those articles there are always people dismising the news saying that people who buy are iphones are seeing them as a status symbol and they imply that they are stupid and sheep. This happens not only in reddit but in websites about smartphones in general.

So I will write my opinion why this is happening according to my experience.

First the things that Apple does right

1 Iphones take better photos: Thats what most people I know think and there is a reason for that. iPhones tend consistently good photos and especially good photos of human subjects which is what most people care about. No shutter lag, no strange skin tones and no fake skin smoothing plus the better camera integration in social media apps. Also I have seen countless video comparisons between various phones so I believe DXOmark results are objective and iphones are consistently among the best.

2 Iphones offer a reliably good experience: Its true that if you are not a poweruser iphones offer a reliable good experience. Better app integration and optimization, more optimized oss with no ads and bugs unlike xiaomi and the best processor unlike samsung and google with tensor and exynos. Plus if something goes wrong better costumer service.

These things gives you a positive opinion about Apple when you buy an iphone and thats how you they gained so much positive mindshare.

On the other hand Android manufacturers

3 Have no long term planing just quick cash grabs: Most Android companies seem to care more about making a quick buck than keeping customers happy in the long run. This mindset becomes obvious by the fake 2mp depth and macro cameras most companies put especially in their mid range and low end devices just to inflate their spec sheets and misguide the customer, by the custom chips that Samsung and Google use as they are worse than what Qualcomm and Mediatek are making, which should be the baseline as this is what any company can buy, by the ads they use in the oss and by the bad costumer support.

All these things temporarily increase the companies profits margins but cheapen the experience and leave a sour taste to people about them and about android in general.

4 Android is losing its cool features: Most of these features are for powerusers but some of them would be usefull for everyone. Android phones used to have stuff like headphone jack, microSD, ir blaster, they implemented first new hardware developmments like high refresh rates and multiple cameras. Now they have nothing new and they get locked down more and more. Meanwhile, iPhones have caught up in terms of hardware and are caching up in features.

Most of the people buying iPhones, are not looking to buy a new smartphone. They are looking to buy a new iPhone. I kid you not, I used to work at a store, and a lot of people would rather buy a 3 year old iPhone than a new Android (Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi etc.) that is better in basically every department for the same price.

Android,oli_alatar,549,"I think Apple is currently succeeding because they know what and to who they are marketting their devices for. Apple is clear - pay a lot, and you can expect a solid, quality device that will rarely break down and will do what most everyday people want it to, and it looks good. If you also want more of our ecosystem, you can enjoy a masdive library of music, cloud storage, etc etc etc.

I feel like in comparison, devices with android have a few benefits - they are generally cheaper, and they are easier to customise. However, I feel like it's a harder sell for a fairly wealthy, not that tech savvy middle class consumer who just wants to chuck a bit of money and recieve a quality and reliable product that is percieved as quality. This group of people are also who a lot of these news articles seem to focus on, and I generally see they miss out the nerds, or working class people globally.

I think on the whole Apple is growing in popularity partly as a result of a growing middle class in countries like South Korea, who wish to not only be comfortably wealthy, but also show it.

I also think a global internet culture has developed as a result of social media, and it prioritises vanity and fashion. In this sort of space, if a business can convince the consumers that their product is a status symbol, then the quality doesn't matter as strongly, in the same way you can see pop stars wearing clothes that you just know would be a pain to put on the morning. We can see this is South Korea or even the states, where Iphones are seen as quality, wealthy devices.",4,neutral,"Main object: Apple and iOS devices

I am surprised how much I am enjoying using this phone. Performance is first class, there has been no lags this whole time.

The battery amazes me, because it is smaller than the samsung and it holds definitely longer and at full performance! Unlike samsung, in motorola I don't have to completely turn on power saving and I can easily use a day.

The screen is really cool, the factory screen protector has held up so far and is like new. The back is also like new, and I carry the phone without a case. No scratches at all. I'm happy as hell.

The main and front cameras take really good pictures. I think it will satisfy 99% of users. Sometimes I would like to play with the 10x zoom like in samsung, but it's an unnecessary byte. Especially considering the price difference.

Android,arrowstoopid,5144,"Opinion: Mainstream reviewers (The Verge, MKBHD, etc) need to start putting serious pressure on Android apps / app developers || At this point, no fancy hardware feature, no Android system update, no stock-like ROM or anything you can imagine will ever bring your experience on Android to the next level. We've nearly reached the limit and everyone knows it. Improvements are extremely incremental and largely don't change how you interact with your device on a day-to-day basis.

Your time on the lock screen, the home screen, looking at the notification shade, tweaking a few niche settings to your likings; those are small moments in time. What you look at and use large and by far *are the apps themselves.*

With all that in mind, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that mainstream tech reviewers continue to harp on the same strings:

* xx GBs of RAM
* 8xx Snapdragon with +7% of performance you'll never see or use
* Screen body ratio
* etc

All this while arguably the most important piece of the puzzle is ignored. 

When mainstream reviewers are doing (for example) their showdown comparisons of the latest iPhone vs the Samsung, iPhone vs the Pixel, etc, they should be mentioning that a good portion of the Android apps are absolute dogshit. Call them out specifically such as Snapchat, Instagram & Facebook. They should of course acknowledge that it's not the phone manufacturers fault, but really start giving the heat to these huge mega corporations for their continually awful treatment of Android users. I pay the same monthly bill as an iOS user on Spotify for half the experience.

On top of inserting it into occasional reviews, (which is fair as they should be reviewing the overall experience, not just listing specs and first impressions) they should also be writing articles about it. Make some noise about it. I'm aware that a few have been written in the past, but they've all gotten very quiet about it in the past years and it's helping nobody. 

If mainstream reviewers continue to shout ""If only my phone had 2 more GB of RAM! If only my screen was 0.2"" larger!"" then that's all we're going to get. Ever.

On the other hand, if the awful app experience starts to generate bad press to everyone involved, who knows, companies like Google & Samsung might even take initiative to cooperate with app developers to create a better experience. Snapchat might eventually snap & officially support select flagships for stock-app-like camera quality. Same with Instagram & Facebook. Beyond camera quality, Samsung & Google might start giving out some ... *ahem* ""incentives"" for major app devs to clean up their act.

Windows Phones were absolutely crucified for their app support. I don't know why Android seems to be getting a free pass. I'm a huge Android fanboy, and I think the only way things are going to improve is if the people with a real voice in the tech community start putting it through the ringer.

Yes, because that's exactly the info I want when I'm reading a review of a phone: how apps I don't use perform on it. Furthermore your argument is that the poor performance isn't specific to the device, so it's more like you're asking for reviewers to complain about the performance of apps _on other phones_.

> if the awful app experience starts to generate bad press

Have you stopped to consider that maybe the performance isn't newsworthy? That maybe, just maybe, you're blowing this out of proportion?

> Windows Phones were absolutely crucified for their app support. I don't know why Android seems to be getting a free pass.

That's because Windows Phone _didn't have the apps at all_. Android apps are, for the most part, equal to their iOS counterparts. I can't think of a major app that's lacking features on Android compared to iOS.

Do I think Android apps could be better? Sure! Do Android app developers have an incentive to make them better? No, not really. Big Android app developers like Snapchat, Facebook, etc. are building apps for _all_ Android phones, not just the latest flagship. The vast majority of their audience is using lower-specced devices, so they don't really have a motivation to make sure that their apps take advantage of all eight-cores, or use the best possible picture quality. (That being said, Snapchat specifically called out the shittiness of their app in their earnings report.

My biggest gripe is how fast and reliably apps update to using new platform features when new OS version comes out — on iOS, there was dozens of apps getting automatic dark mode and other iOS 13 stuff on the hour it was released; on Android, you have to wait for months for the same treatment. Even today there's several high profile apps that don't have Android 10 features.

Not saying the iOS counterparts are always better — far from it. There's many apps (and whole app categories) where their Android counterparts are way smoother and better than on iOS. Every Google app runs so much better on Android and has a better feature set, there's better and more feature-rich Reddit clients, 3rd-party browsers actually exist, there's just much bigger potential what Android apps can do.

When you have iPhone, you have one of the best phones that came out for that year. If you make the switch and opt for a cheaper android option, be aware you are not making a fair comparison when you eventually compare your experiences. Yes, the cheaper xiaomi or pixel might do all the same things and maybe even more, but you also have build quality and materials and overall attention to detail in hardware and software to consider.

For the comparison to be fair IMO you would be best suited by moving to a Samsung Galaxy S series, or something of that calibre and value and price range. Otherwise, after a year or so of use you may start to notice little things that make you think the switch was a bad decision. Do what you feel is right, but my suggestion is to not compare unless you shelled out for something that actually competes with your previous device in all aspects.

Android's nav system is lauded for its ability to swipe back from either side of the screen, any time any where (sensitivity can be adjusted as well), which is a far cry from the iOS method of sliding from the left side specifically (and only within certain apps).

Swipe to delete is fully present and functional in Android too - at least it is on my Pixel's Gboard.

At the time we got the Motorola RAZR M. At that point my ""Apple mindset"" broke. I discovered what felt like a new world. A real file system, default apps, you could install apps and programs outside of the official app store, way more settings and configurations. I was mind blown at the time.

Over the years I had a couple times where I got an iPhone. I had the XR and 12 but it never felt right or always seemed weird as I had adapted to Android. iOS and Apple's restrictions would drive me insane. After my first Android the RAZR M, I have had the Galaxy S5, Galaxy S8 and Nexus 6. Currently I have the Galaxy S23 Plus.

iOS was not always the mess it has become. I have no idea what happened to iOS today. It has not advanced as well as Android has.

Personally I stick with Android for the original reasons I stayed from getting my first Android among others.

* Clipboard management. Still does not exist on iOS
* Real filesystem
* Compatible file formats with other OS's
* Notifications. Something Apple still has not come close with on iOS
* Actionable notifications
* Browsers work normally with their respective engines and addons
* Default apps across the OS
* 3rd party keyboards work better. Surprised how janky or not much support for them on iOS
* Background app support not as aggressive as iOS
* App sideloading
* Real multitasking
* OEM's put more features on lower end phones that Apple only puts on the Pro lineup

Currently, tho, most of that customization is skin-deep (and must be, for security reasons, now that we use phones for so much more than just cat memes).  Thus the line between Android and iOS is thinner than ever.

Android,Due_Schedule5256,46,"I used Android until the iPhone 7 came out, bought several iPhones and was satisfied until iOS 16. Suddenly a bunch of random bugs and issues with battery occurred. I realized that Apple was also at a creative dead end, it was getting very boring and now buggy. 

I switched to the S23 ultra a few months ago and it feels like I've advanced two or three years from iOS. For example the underscreen fingerprint reader; face ID just never worked for me and it got very old typing in the password every time. Or the front camera cut out, Apple is still sticking with this notch thing that makes no sense. 

Android feels much faster because iOS is still having to accommodate lower refresh screens. 

The main downside with Android (Samsung I should specify) is, out of the box I feel like I spent almost a week  clearing out all the bloat, installing the superior Google apps, getting them all set up etc it really would not be ideal for a novice user if they want the best experience out of the box. iOS still dominates in that category.

Google Messages is quite good but I need to supplement it with WhatsApp to send high quality videos to contacts which is a bummer but no big deal really.

> Shortcuts automation: I find it is much easier and better integrated than Tasker but I don't use them that much actually

Tasker is the power user app but you have Samsung's Modes and Routines for the more polished alternative. You also have a middle ground with Automate which uses actual visual flowcharts for you automations.

> Swipe gestures

I actually consider this a win for Android. I went from navigation buttons to swipe gestures with my S8 and the ability to swipe from an edge to go back no matter what's on the screen seems way easier then trying to work out which corner has the back button in any given iPhone screen.

> A wider array of great paying apps and even those that are on both platforms tend to be (slightly) better executed in iOS

Not sure about this one. Telegram, for example, I think used to release new features on Android a bit ahead of iPhone because of Apple's App Store vetting process. There are also loads of apps that you could only have on Android, especially if you're a bit more technical, like Termux, ReVanced and Syncthing.

> Pdf editor

Samsung Notes can be set as the default to open PDFs and it's very powerful. Annotations, reordering pages, signatures, attachments, etc


I also think even with Apple's better vertical integration between their hardware and OS, Samsung still makes a device that looks nicer and feels better in the hand.

Android,Justkiller91,64,"Never ""switched"", but have worked closely with both platforms over the years.  Including   initial operations of the first Apple Authorised repair partner in my province. And heres my perspective:

Personally I enjoy and utilise the abilities of customisation of Android based devices.  The availability of parts.  And the wide range of devices to better match user use case.  Multiple options for 3rd party solutions is a huge bonus for compatibility.  Big downside is some manufacturers staright up ditch their  devices and let their performance and security updates decay rapidly.

Apple on the other hand, doesn't have the freedom or catalog of devices available nor the 3rd party solutions. They like to crack down on 3rd party part suppliers and limit 3rd party repairs under the guise of ""security"", which pisses me off.   However if you are already part of the Apple eco-system and just need a phone to call, text and run the odd app here and there, you're golden.  That and lets be real, Apple Care warranty is very very convenient.

Lots of people when swapping say ""Android is too confusing or overwhelming"" is a cop out imo.  This excuse just points out unwillingness to learn, rather than reflect on the devices.

Android,FacelessGreenseer,24223,"Fix for majority of UI stutters and scrolling lag on Samsung Galaxy Devices: || **EDIT:** A lot of great information in the comments added by u/eNB256 if anyone wants extra information:

---

Already confirmed with the S22 Community that this has helped many, so I am sharing the information with the wider community. Would be great if more people with **Samsung Galaxy** devices can test if this fixes the UI lag, camera app lags, and scrolling lag issues on social media apps like Twitter and Facebook.

**WARNING: Only for Samsung Galaxy phones. Do not install these apps for non-Galaxy devices.**

**Try to find these apps in the Galaxy Store first, as they might be available in your region, however, for some they could be region locked or device locked and the APK's can be found below:**

First, download and install the latest **Samsung Good Guardians** app, if you downloaded this through the **Galaxy Store**, you can download all other apps suggested below from within the **Good Guardians** app, otherwise grab the latest APK from below:

[https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/galaxy-labs/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/galaxy-labs/)

 **Then:**

Download and install the latest **Samsung Galaxy App Booster**

[https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/app-booster/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/app-booster/)

Run **Good Guardians**, and through that app, you run the **Galaxy App Booster**.

Using **Galaxy App Booster**, click on **OPTIMIZE NOW** and wait for it to complete the process.

As Samsung recommends, run this feature once a week, and immediately after a system update to keep your phone running smooth. Enjoy. 

*Why these official apps don't come baked into the phone or auto run in the background once a week for example is beyond me. Instead we get a load of bloatware, yay* 😑

That's it, that fixed most of my stutters when nothing else helped fix the stutters I was having with my S22 Ultra.

 There still remains a little bit of stutter & lag, but nowhere near as bad as before.

**EXTRA Information:**

 I personally use **Samsung Thermal Guardian** too:

[https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-thermal-guardian/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-thermal-guardian/)

Using **Thermal Guardian**, I increase the **Thermal Threshold** to maximum (*click the + sign a couple of times*). This allows the CPU to run at hotter temperatures, and sustain boosted clock speeds for longer, however, I also use **Additional Settings** to ""*Limit CPU Boosting when Heating*"", this prevents the CPU from over-heating. What I have found, is that these two combined allow the CPU to run between 70% and 90% power, giving an overall more fluid performance, without over-heating the device, resulting in better battery life when doing strenuous tasks.

If you have used the information in above, then I also set **Processing Speed** to **Maximum**, when combined with Limited Boosting, it provides a better overall experience. To activate Maximum Processing Speed, go to device **Settings**, then ""*Battery and Device Care*"", then ""*Battery*"", then ""*More battery settings*"", then ""*Processing Speed*"", then set to ""*Maximum*"".

There are more apps in Good Guardian which you might also find helpful. Another one worth checking out is the **Memory Guardian**.",145,positive,"Main object: Samsung Galaxy Devices

Android,getmoneygetpaid,7434,"S23 Review for choosy users || # The Samsung S23 nearly gets lots of things right.

Me again to tell you the things about devices that professional reviewers won’t. I recently reviewed my [Zenfone 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/xic1o1/zenfone_9_critique_the_good_the_bad_and_the_very/), [Samsung S22](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/tsltye/warning_the_s22_is_has_terrible_battery_life_and/) and [Xiaomi 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/coomments/11t0qyh/xiaomi_13_review_for_pedantic_jerks/). Now I’m here to tell you what will annoy you about the Samsung S23.b

Disclaimer: as ever, I’m being picky. I have a professional digital-design background, and I am particularly sensitive to UI / UX, so will be critiquing it heavily. If you don’t care abocut polish or attention to detail, this review isn’t for you. If you're all about manually tweakable features over appearance, these thigns may not annoy you. If you’re a die-hard Samsung fan, you won’t like this either so it's probably best to stop reading.

And no, my device, along with the previous 10 devices I’ve owned, is not faulty. Nobody is that unlucky. I am just attentive to small details. If you didn’t notice these issues, great. Enjoy your device. But they exist.

## The Bad

I’ll start with what you came for: what’s going to bug you if you’re a details-focused user.

## Camera

The camera is actually ~~better~~ less blurry than expected, but I'm still listing it as bad overall. I mostly take photos of moving things (friends, kids, pets, sports) and most phones suck at this. The Pixel and iPhone are excellent, and the Xiaomi 13 was damned close. The [Zenfone 9 was beyond abysmal](https://imgur.com/a/btSApvS). The Samsung is… [OK](https://imgur.com/a/KKZEjBq). Like, I don’t worry I’m going to miss a moment, as I did with Asus, but it’s definitely less consistent than the top tier.

Where it sucks is colour. I’m colourblind (which means I don’t see some colours as strongly), so I generally like slightly over-saturated colours that make it easier for me to tell what colour things are. However, this is just too much, even for me. Colours are way, way too saturated. For example, [grass looks acid green](https://i.imgur.com/n4iafvP.jpeg) and just wrong. Photos come out looking like [Telly-tubby land compared to an iPhone or Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/yIBkKaG.jpg), and I can’t work out where to tone this down. I just want the point-and-shoot photos/videos/portrait results to be normal, and they aren’t. I guess some people must like this, but I find it disgusting.

Every other manufacturer lets you tone down the vibrancy of colours in the camera, but not Samsung. As with everything in OneUI, you can change 1000 things, but can't change the parts that matter for a good experience.

You can use Pro Mode, but then you lose HDR and so lose detail in the dark and bright spots of your photos (and it's already worse at this than Pixel / iPhone). Plus, I shouldn’t have to - the phone should work for me, not vice-versa. 

You can use Expert Raw mode, but this cranks the saturation even crazier.

I tried installing GCam, but current ports have tonnes of stability issues and I don't want to miss moments. For example, some modes don’t work at all and will just crash the camera. Also, having to remember which camera you open for each scenario is tiring and tine consuming. I just want it to quickly launch and take a good photo.

After a week, I hate what this does to colours so much that I may well return the device. My phone is my only camera, and this one is poor.

## OK Google stops working

I’m not an idiot, so I use Google Assistant instead of Bixby. My issue is that ‘OK Google’ detection stops working throughout the day. Usually, if I haven’t used Assistant for an hour, it simply won’t pick up ‘OK Google’ when I come to it and most of the time you're just left looking like an idiot having a one-way conversation with a beligerent object. I’ve tried clearing cache, re-installing, turning off all kinds of battery efficiency options etc. Basically, I just can’t rely on it working, which is super annoying for me as I use it a lot. A hands'free assisttant that requires hands is pretty pointless.

**UPDATE: A week later, this has magically fixed itself (but see limitations under bluetooth, below).**

## Bluetooth and Pixel Buds Pro woes

I have continuous issues with bluetooth devices and this handset, which I haven’t experienced with and of my other handsets (Windows, iPhone, Pixel, Xiaomi, Zenfone). *Usually*, music will play fine, but calls intermittently only come through one bud, or the recipient will complain they can’t hear me clearly. They’ll randomly transfer the call back to the phone in my pocket half way through calls.

Another issue I face is with the multipoint. Bluetooth devices will show as ‘connected’ in my Bluetooth settings, but audio simply won’t play (through them or the speaker) and will just revert to a ‘paused’ state. This seems to be when the buds are connected to another device simultaneously with my S23 via multipoint. None of the other devices seem to care, but the S23 hates sharing. I’ve had to turn it off.

**UPDATE:  I've found Reddit posts from years ago re: Samsung phones and Pixel Buds, so this seems to be a long-standing issue with Pixel Buds and Samsung handsets exclusively. If you turn off 'OK Google' detection on the buds, calls will come through both buds. I haven't experienced this with any other OEM paired with my Pixel Buds. It is hard to say whether this is a Google issue or a Samsung issue, but I can confidently say that there isn't an issue with the same buds when used with Google, Asus, Xiaomi or Apple handsets.**

**If you want to lisen to music on your Pixxel Buds with an S23, you need to disable multipoint in the Buds settings. Bummer.**

Frequently, the phone won’t auto-connect to my car stereo. I have to connect it manually. I’ve had the same car for 10 years, across probably 12 phones, and this is unique to the S23.

It will connect to my wife's car stereo (2016 Skoda) for calls, but won't play music audio. It just keeps toggling that setting off.

**UPDATE: When I called Samsung's support, their advice was that it's Skoda's fault and to change my car to a more modern one if I want to use a Samsung phone reliably. If you have a car more than 3 years old, don't buy a Samsung phone as they don't bother with backwards compatibility in their Bluetooth stack. However, I finally figured out a workaround myself. After connecting the Samsung S23 to a Skoda (Volkswagen) car stereo, you'll get a popup on the phone asking it to share contacts.** **Do not allow this! Or you'll have to forget the connection on both devices and re-pair next time you get in your car.** **I am having flashbacks to my Galaxy S2 (yep, that long ago) and remember it did the same thing in my old Honda at the time, in 2011, which is what prompted me to try this. How on earth has this been unadressed by Samsung for 12 years?** 

Overall, it’s like Bluetooth from the days before it worked properly, and I hate it. I don't like having to turn off the premium features of my Pixel Buds Pro exclusively for Samsung.

## Call issues

It drops calls sometimes, or the line is bad more than other devices. I don’t know if this is unique to my area or carrier or something like that, but I have dropped more calls in my two weeks with this device than in the last year combined. It also seems to struggle to hold onto carrier signal in my home office, where I have weak signal, but have never had an issue making calls with other handsets on the same carrier. And that’s coming from the Pixel 6 and 7: two devices known for having crappy radios. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is just another annoyance.

**EDIT - OK I now realise the problem. This device can two sim cards. If I place my sim in slot 1, it intermittently drops signal every 10 minutes for about 30 seconds. The same sim is fine in the other 3 or 4 handsets I've tried it in, so I guess this is either a hardware issue, or a compatibility issue between Samsung and my EE micro sim.**

## Bugs

In my experience, Samsung software rarely works smoothly, and this phone’s experience  is no exception. It’s *always* up to something weird and there is a general lack of polish to the experience. This isn’t a comprehensive list, but here are a couple that I frequently experience:

· The status bar frequently shows no data even when there is some. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/JP2OPL1.jpg) you can see me running an internet speed test over data whilst the device is informing me that there’s no internet connectivity. This is a regular occurrence. You may as well ignore the network indicators with this device.

· After the system switches between Dark Mode and Regular Mode, Apps get stuck in some kind of strange [half-dark-mode](https://i.imgur.com/GWsjLGt.jpg) state where the UI will show half dark and half regular. Often it'll be black text on a black background, meaning you can't read notifications on screen. I’ve never seen this before on other devices.

· Integrations generally don’t work well. For example, trying to add my Philips Hue to SmartThings just results in an [error](https://i.imgur.com/xgEvT8J.jpg). I don’t use Samsung services much, but this is pretty typical of my experience when I do – some aspect of the configuration phase won’t work properly. To be honest, this was the first integration I tried with Smart Things on this device, and it just reminded me why I avoid Samsung's software when possible.

· You’ll frequently get a message on your lockscreen telling you that your face didn’t match, next to the unlocked symbol, which only shows because it matched your face. It’s just bad UI.

· You turn off hardware keyboard notifications, but they still show.

I could go on and on; the whole experience just feels very… untested.

## Samsung doesn’t do usability – this is why people think Android requires you to be a geek.

Basically, it feels like you’re working for your phone instead of it working for you. The other devices I used this year (Apple, Google, Xiaomi, Asus) learn your routine and do clever, quality-of-life things automatically. You don’t really need to think about it – they’ll just save you time by learning your routine, and you can always turn that stuff off if you don’t like it.

Samsung offers a tonne of features that I don’t need, but continues to miss the mark on the basics. I can often find ways around these limitations using Good Lock, Samsung’s ‘Modes and Routines’ app, Macrodroid etc, but it’s very manual and imperfect. It feels like the relationship is backwards – my phone should make my life easier, but it feels like I’m working for my phone instead of it working for me.

Some examples:

* There’s no adaptive charging. My Pixel (and all other devices) would not charge to 100% until just before my alarm went off each day, so as to prolong the battery health. There’s nothing like this on Samsung. I managed to create something similar using modes and routines, but it’s horrible and requires a lot of manual intervention if you don’t wake up at consistent times (eg. You have kids or work hybrid and sometimes commute).
* There is no ‘Sleep Mode’ as it exists on other devices – ie. where your device goes to Do Not Disturb only when plugged into power AND after a certain time in the evening. I had to make this myself for this device.
* There’s also no ‘auto end DND mode when alarm goes off’. Again, I had to make this myself and it just isn’t as good as native integration.

I seem to spend a lot more time turning things off-and-on than I ever did, and I’m always worried that I’ll forget to change something and my alarms won’t go off, or my ringer will silence itself in the day etc. After years of Pixel, I’ve just got used to not having to think about this stuff and it feels like a huge step backwards.

Trying to add your Samsung account for the first time in a while will ask you to input the IMEI of a device that you haven’t owned for years. Mine wanted my Galaxy Watch 2’s IMEI, which I haven’t owned in like 3 years. This adds a 2 day delay on to using your phone whilst Samsung’s janky customer support goes through authentication. Nobody at Samsung has thought about how this shit experience affects the first-impressions of setting up the device.

## Samsung still needs to hire UI designers

I’ve discussed this [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/nbv0mw/pixel_users_things_youll_hate_about_oneui/), and I know I’m going to trigger Samsung evangelists with this one, but Samsung’s UI is still the worst of the lot. I’m not talking the subjective parts of design that I *personally* don’t like. I mean, things are just not designed using graphic design **best-practice**.

Polarising Fisher-Price squircle icons don’t match the rest of the design language – and the UI can’t decide if it’s circular or squircular as there are [both scattered throughout](https://i.imgur.com/1ZktDOS.jpg), often in the same menus. It’s such an odd choice to go with non-geometric shapes in a UI as they’re obviously polarising.

Overly-rounded corner-radius is not appropriate for such a small screen and causes Samsung to break their padding consistency to fit content in.

Iconography can’t decide if it’s linear or solid.

Mis-matching of the user's font and some other narrower font that you can’t change in random places in the UI.

Inconsistent sizing of notifications, where they're completely [different widths](https://i.imgur.com/wDU3gvM.jpg) (neither designed to a grid).

It seems Samsung has never heard of [vertical rhythm](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/8-point-grid-vertical-rhythm-90d05ad95032) which is a big red flag that they're either lazy or inexperienced designers.

This isn’t stuff that’s just ‘my preference’ – this is graphic design 101 and objective errors that an experienced designer simply wouldn’t make. As a professional interface designer, I’ve spent hours monkeying around with Good Lock and Hex (see below) and still can’t get it consistent – even with a commitment to ongoing manual effort. No other UIs have these overt interface-design issues – even the crazy Chinese ones. Samsung really need to up their out-of-the-box user experience.

## Good Lock and _Hex# are solutions to a problem that shouldn’t exist.

A lot of the above can be solved with a combination of Good Lock and Hex, but it’s not ideal. Don’t get me wrong; it’s better to have Good Lock than not. But no matter how hard you work, you’re going to end up with jank, a tonne of ongoing manual work to keep on top of it, and an ongoing battle between the Hex developers and OneUI releases.

For example, you can change icon shapes from squircle to circle, but you’ll still find squircles tucked away that pop up and surprise you at random points in your usage. And of course, you have to re-build and re-apply your *entire* Theme Park theme every time you install a new app, which always seems to over-write icon preferences, causing further work.

You can edit your lockscreen to get rid of the erroneous face-match message above, but then no matter what you do, you’ll end up with notifications [overlapping other elements](https://i.imgur.com/JAfZTo9.jpg) and it generally looking bad. Or you have to leave huge gaps, breaking the vertical-rhythm of the layout.

Using Hex themes, some icons end up as illegible, being [white icons on a white background](https://i.imgur.com/dfLIem8.jpg) with no easy way to change them etc. And you're completely reliant on the Hex plugin developers to fix [UI bugs](https://i.imgur.com/skmoDHy.jpg), which they don't - at least not for months.

I was able to change my power button long press with Good Lock to open an app. However, I changed my mind, reverted to default behaviour, and uninstalled the Good Lock module. Something went wrong, and now I have to keep the Google Lock module installed forevermore, because if I uninstall it, the button behaviour reverts to opening the app instead of the power menu. Arrgh!

Basically, these tools are hard work, and the end result is still not as clean / consistent as it would be if it worked properly out of the box. It’s clear that a few dedicated devs at Samsung noticed the shortfalls of the OneUI core and have tried to help users overcome them, but it feels like an afterthought and it is not at all a polished experience. You simply shouldn’t have to rely on janky community workarounds.

## Launcher

The OneUI launcher sucks. The horizontal scrolling app drawer is just nasty and slow. And there’s no alphabetical shortcut. Sure, you can change this with Good Lock/HomeUp, but then it looks like [this atrocity](https://i.imgur.com/em0ZAHW.jpg). I don't even know where to start with the issues here. Two rows of irremovable 'recent apps' icons taking up 40% of the screen? The fact that some of the text labels over-run into other elements and get cut off? How about the top icon grid not aligning with the bottom one? It's just objectively incorrectly designed. Samsung evangelists will frequently tell you that you can change anything you don't like via Good Lock, but this is exactly the kind of result you'll get in doing so.

You can always swap launcher to something like Nova, but since Android 10, that’s going to result in a [very clunky experience](https://www.xda-developers.com/third-party-launchers-animation-pixel-phones/); devoid of the smooth closing animations that only stock launchers can offer, and with pretty broken multi-tasking. If you care about experience, third party launchers just aren’t really viable any more – the out of the box experience needs to be better.

## The Good

## Hardware

The hardware is lovely overall. It feels super solid. I’d have preferred a plastic back like the S21, which felt lighter, but small devices are rare, so I’ll take what I can get.

The size is good. I’d prefer a little narrower, but due to the Zenfone 9’s crumby camera and dated looks, I’d say it’s the best ‘small’ android phone right now. Also, the one-handed-mode is much better than any competition as it actually resizes your screen, rather than just cuting the bottom of like the ixel and iPhone.

The symmetrical bezels make it look generations better than the Pixel 7 – super premium.

I love the camera lens design. The strange hump of the S22, which made it look like some kind of feminine make-up case is gone. It’s now very industrial looking. This design makes the iPhone look busy in comparison. Well done, Samsung!

The battery life is fine. It’s not going to break any records, but it consistently lasts the day. Probably a little better than my Pixel 7, but still not as good as my Pixel 6.

It’s nice to have a flagship chipset. It isn’t quite as smooth as my Pixel 7 despite the more powerful chip, but it’s fine and it is fast enough at heavier tasks like processing images and videos.

Fingerprint reader is perfect. My Pixel 6/7 just didn’t like my fingers unless I licked my thumb before unlocking. I had maybe a 1/10 success rate unlocking the device. The S23 is damned near 100%.

&#x200B;

## Software

Not everything Samsung did was awful. It’s nice to have a bit more control than the Pixel of some aspects of the software experience. The multiwindow is great. Being able to hide the fingerprint animations is fantastic. You aren't stuck with the ugly 'at a glance' widget on your homescreen.

You can change a lot, which might be your jam, although as above, I can never get it quite to my liking.

Samsung also have some nice touches with their screenshot tool and document scanning in the camera.

## Ecosystem

It’s nice to have Galaxy SmartTags. It’d be better if the smaller S23 had UWB Bluetooth, which seems a strange omission as both it’s bigger brothers have it. However, they still work good enough.

It also plays a little better with my Galaxy Watch 5.

It was very easy to find a quad lock and magsafe case.

## Conclusion

This is why iPhone users think Android is for geeks who spend time fiddling with their handset. Samsung doesn’t give you a choice – they have made some very polarising choices and ommisions that are difficult to work around

I’m going to keep it because it’s the only reasonably-sized flagship with current gen specs in my opinion, and the ecosystem is stronger than any other Android OEM’s. But I am fully aware that I’m going to spend my time being annoyed about poor design choices.

**EDIT: I've now spoken to samsung. I'm out of my cooling off period, but I was hoping they'd make an exception given that I've been discovering more and more issues. The couldn't. Their suggestion is to buy a more modern car because S23 is modern and Samsung don't worry about backwards compatibility - even with pretty static technology like Bluetooth. They believe that my car stereo, Pixel buds, and sim card are all independently broken, even though they work with every other device I've tried.**

Samsung is a massive company. We shouldn't have to fix their design just so it looks okay. It should just look good out and be consistent with the box and be tweakable additionally. 


I'll also echo this is why iPhone users think android is only for geeks who like to play with their phone. OEMs like Samsung make that seem almost universally true by basically forcing you to micro manage and maintain everything instead of it just working.

I feel like not enough people know this but, funnily enough, Samsung are the only brand of Android phone that I know of where third-party launchers **are** usable with gestures. 

The problem with most other Android phones is that they all use the stock ASOP gestures, which do lead to broken animations and lag when swiping up to go home, etc. Samsung, however, [also offer their own variant](https://i.imgur.com/bQqdLJi.png) that allow you to swipe up from each of the three (hidden) navigation buttons at the bottom edge of the screen. 

Not only do these gestures work smoothly with third party launchers with zero lag, but they also free up the sides of the display for additional custom gestures via One Hand Operation+. 

This, plus Good Lock allowing users to replace the utterly useless Android one-app-at-a-time horizontal scrolling recents with functional, vertical scrolling cards, are the main things keeping me with Samsung right now.

I have multiple Bluetooth headphones and earbuds connected. I have airpod pros 2, galaxy buds pro 2, Sony wfxm3 and seinheser headphones.

I don't have the second issue you're talking about. 

I don't have a car with Bluetooth either so I can't comment on that.

I take multiple calls all throughout the day without any issues, are you sure it's not a carrier issue?

Samsung flagships are notriuos for shutter delay/lag but the latest April update has addressed that and now I can take photos of my kids and animals just fine. 80% of the time the pics aren't blurry or out of focus anymore.

IOS,SirD28,1793,"iPhone 11 Review || Hello Again,

I wrote last year this review and it got huge responses on the iPhone XR and figured why not do it again.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9zorpd/iphone\_xr\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9zorpd/iphone_xr_review/)

&#x200B;

So I traded in my Product Red 128GB Iphone XR, for a Black iPhone 11 and here are my thoughts on the device if your deciding on making the move.

Design and Build

Pretty much same as last years XR, but I do love what they did with the Camera bump this year with the one milled piece of glass. Not sure how that magic is done, but it gives the phone a 3D look to it and the matte on the camera bump does make me wish for the entire thing to be matte. Again Aluminum body which is fine as almost all flagships are still doing aluminum for their phone bodies, aluminum is much easier to machine as steel is much harder to machine and cost a lot more to money to produce.

Weakness of this year's lineup is the colors to me, they went very easter egg pastel colors, I would like more rich colors, but that is a matter of taste. Would love a midnight blue, or like the Product Red which is a deep red. The purple is nice if you like purple and its probably to me the best new color. The Green is very spearmint to me and i prefer darker greens then the lighter shades. The removal of blue was kind of a head scratcher as it was my 2nd favorite color to Product Red in last years Xr. I went back to black, well because black goes with everything, and to be honest I got tired of the colors, maybe I'm just basic.

Screen

Same screen as the XR which is fine.....  This phone screen is good, if you a screen nerd its not going to blow you away but its far from people saying it sucks, and it's a 720P screen.  First off its not 720P its 828P ok!

Also the PPI is 326 and people complain how its low rez, but say how awesome the iPad Pro Screens are at 264.... Yes it is a sub 1080p panel, but there's more to a screen then just resolution. Color, Brightness, is all here and it's very good. iPhonedo did a review on the 11 recently and compared the phone without telling you which phone was which doing a 4k source video on both. The note made it 1440p and the iPhone 1080p then to 828p, I'll be honest during the blind I thought the iPhone was better looking.  Now I am not saying the iPhone 11 has better screen then the Note, but in certain images with a lot of light and color the iPhone will hold its own against it, it just won't when it comes to dark things because OLED will always be king here.

Battery

1 Hour longer then the battery champ Xr, sign me up! This is the simplest part of the review the Xr was great at battery and you get 1 hour longer, this thing is a tank and is only really surpassed by the big brother iPhone 11 Pro Max which lets face it has just a huge battery.....

But one note good on Apple to finally listen and make the Pro's thicker and bigger and put a good size battery finally in these things. People ripped on the Xr ""budget phone"" and ""thic boy"" but in the end lot of tech people went with the Xr over the Xs because of battery life. Apple is killing it right now with battery life!

Camera

This is the main reason why I traded in my XR. Apple killed the camera this year, I have a two year old and my phone is my camera, so when the cameras have huge upgrades like this year, I upgrade because I take pictures of my baby with this device and I have it on me at all times. Now I know DSLR and real cameras take better photos but we are getting closer and closer to saying a Phone Camera is close enough that everyday people don't need a seperate camera, and professionals in the next few years might not either.

Wide Angle was the right move, I actually mentioned it in my XR Review that I would prefer Wide Angle to Telephoto, I am very happy with the 2 camera array that Apple chose the Wide Angle. You can just take way more dramatic shots IMO then a slight zoom from the telephoto.

Last years XR has a great camera, but the software seems to do weird things sometimes with the Smart HDR, in perfect light you will get great shots on the XR but when the lighting isn't ideal the XR can fall apart. All of this has been fixed in the 11 and improved by a huge amount, only issue I have seen with the 11 is it does like to sharpen a lot, but honestly you might like that and it's only really weird if you zooming in on objects in the photos.

Night Mode is amazing and puts it right up there with the pixel. This camera is amazing at night where this was the XR's Achilles Heel IMO. You will be able to take photos and just wow yourself, go out and take some night photos because you never could before with an iPhone.

Video is king on this phone, Image Stabilization is crazy good, so much I didn't even need a tripod setup doing video with my kid, but when I showed people the video they were surprised it wasn't on some kind of tripod setup.  4k 60 on the back and front, the iPhone is PowerHouse when it comes to Video and IMO no other phone is even close.

Summary

So in summary, good design not great, performance champion, and camera that is amazing. This is the iPhone to get for most people, if your a screen snob or really want that telephoto lens then there is the pro, but man this year there is even lesser reasons to get the pro.

The iPhone 11 lower price of $699 now, which you should never get by the way grab the 128 gb for $749. And the Pro which is smaller size and 64gb storage which you can't get 128gb so you have to move to 256 gb for $150 more. So now your at $1150 or $1250 for the max. To me the telephoto and the OLED are not worth $400 - $500 difference it just isn't.

&#x200B;

Thanks again for reading the review and I hope this helps your buying decisions if you plan on getting a phone this year!

The camera on this thing is just ALOT better than the Xr,which was already a very capable camera.

The battery life is noticeably better. The extra 1gb of ram helps alot. I would swipe to close apps on the Xr and it would need me to do 2 times,it popped up again on the screen after force closing. Its gone now.
Less reload on safari and apps in general.

I have to do with this phone for the coning 2 years untill my next upgrade,as im not rich enough 2 buy phones every year.

IOS,69andthen96,865,"> First off its not 720P its 828P ok! 

Haha aight fam chill out! 

On a more serious note, can't agree more with the last paragraph. My thoughts were initially to get the Pro because of the smaller screen (since I don't have the largest hands) and the better camera and screen. I later went into a John Lewis' to look at the screens of the XR and the XS side-by-side and didn't see a massive difference. I don't watch a lot of videos on my phone, instead preferring a bigger laptop screen. Additionally, it didn't seem to make a lot of sense for me to pay about  £230 extra just for a better screen and a telephoto lens since they weren't high on my priority list. 

Coming from a iPhone 6S, which seemed to lose 30% battery as soon as I switched on Mobile Data, the battery life on this is mind-blowing. I was interested in testing how long the battery would actually last me. Started at 100% at 7.15AM on day 1 and ended up with \~ 6% at 9.00PM on day 2 after fairly normal data usage and quite a lot of podcasts on the speakers. If this were on my 6S, I would've busted through at least 200% of charge for all this.",3,positive,"Main object: iPhone

IOS,ianepperson,1512,"Yeah, my usage will change: it’ll dramatically drop. I interact with Reddit 99% of the time (a guess) through my phone. Once a month or so I’ll go to the website for something - often to respond with a better keyboard (mobile keyboards are a PAIN for code samples.) When I’m waiting for something, I scroll through Reddit on my phone - which turns into me commenting and sometimes posting. After the 1st, I wont. I’ll likely keep this account - heck I might reply in this thread for a bit longer - but I’m not going to be looking through Reddit in the corners of my day. My engagement will drop precipitously and I’ll find something else to fill the corners of my day - maybe Lemmy. Yeah, it’s wonky, but the Fediverse is WAY less likely to move against the users’ best interests. There’s not this single CEO that gets to make unilateral decisions and it’s much more likely to be around for another 10 years.

Or not. Maybe this move makes Reddit become some kind of crazy awesome site with the top-rated mobile app and a reasonable balance of advertising. I really don’t think that’s likely at all. I suspect that if Reddit manages to live to an IPO, it’ll all go to shit once the growth numbers are down for a quarter and the org scrambles to DO SOMETHING to make the stock go up again.

I mean, they’ve been trying to DO SOMETHING now for awhile by adding a bunch of features that few people use and almost no one has asked for. The API changes are another attempt to see if they can move the numbers up faster. But they don’t want to face reality - Reddit has succeeded by being a (mostly good) steward of their communities. They think that if they can get the right combination of features then the rest doesn’t matter, but it does.

I’ve worked with software teams that work on a feature and create some kind of A/B test to show that the feature increased engagement by x% (usually very small) and therefore translates into $y increased profits… and see! This feature we’ve been working on paid for itself! Programmers and middle managers LOVE showing those kinds of graphs (yeah, I do too) but they’re almost always complete fabrications. I once worked with a statistician-turned-developer who pointed out that to get any real result we’d have to run the experiment for years, not just a month or 3. You make sure to release your feature just before a predicted bump in engagement (long weekend, holidays, whatever) and your chart looks GREAT. However, for something like Reddit where the network effect from the users creates engagement, it’s extremely difficult to tease out these results - particularly when your most engaged users (that create most of the content that people are here for) ARE NOT participating in your A/B tests because they’re just API users. Reddit is dropping the ball, but probably have charts to show how everything will be great. And if you show upper management a chart they like, they usually don’t dig into it or question it or check your methodology.

There’s another very large issue with companies that exist to advertise to users. Facebook, Instagram, Google and Reddit behave a specific way where they depend on users but only make money on advertising. These orgs pretend to be data-driven and show advertisers how the money they’ve spent is being effective. But although those charts are technically accurate, they often overlook huge issues that are near impossible to account for. EBay stopped advertising on Google when they realized that they were spending a TON of money and it wasn’t actually providing any benefit - all the while with graphs showing how effective the ads were. While typing this, I changed the radio station because I just heard the SAME AD for the 3rd time in the last hour. The advertising consultant will happily show you a chart about how much engagement the ads are creating… but with no resulting bump in revenue or growth. I have close friends who’ve been in the software industry for over 20 years who wont touch any ad-backed company again - it’s almost always a house of cards with beautiful graphs showing how everything is just fine but no actual value is created. As long as the stock goes up, who cares, right?

So here we are. These are my conjectures, and I think I’m probably, like 80% right. But I’m not paid in Reddit options nor do I have any professional skin in this game.I also have zero interest in playing it.",1,negative,"Main object: Reddit

It’s kinda funny you say this. The battery on the Apple MagSafe power bank is 7.6V instead of ~3.8V most other power banks are. Effectively what this means is that you have to double the mAh number to get a value you can compare with other power banks.

A ridiculously hot phone that will charge extremely slow and also lose a lot of mah for nothing. Of the 5000 advertised you’re probably using 1000 because of the dissipated heat.

* High res OLED display
* USB-C
* Modern design (Pixel 4a)

I'm not so sure now. I really like everything I see and I was looking for news frequently before it released. But I'm concerned about the battery, a lot. 

My wife went from the old SE to the new one and even the first day or two she was saying the battery wasn't much better than her old phone. She had her old SE a little over a year so the battery wasn't awful but she had to charge it a few times a day.

I know all the anecdotes.... Apple is more efficient, just charge it in the car etc... I don't think we should be making excuses for a phone in 2020 that can't last a whole day with moderate use. It's really a shame that it seems like they knocked it out of the park with everything but you still need to charge it to make it last the whole day. And these phones are a few days old. It's only going to get worse.

That's my rant and my experience to anyone thinking about getting one. I'd have a hard time switching from my current phone that can last almost 2 days without charging to one that can't make it a whole day, no matter how good the other parts are.

IOS,Cryptic0677,916,"Android user from day 1 here, been looking for an opportunity or reason to switch to iOS for various reasons, mainly Google's poor lifetime support even of Pixel devices.

I want to like this phone but it has real tradeoffs with the Pixel a series. Smaller battery, no headphone jack, smaller screen (for same footprint), no OLED. Probably a worse camera, since the Pixel a gets the full camera from the flagship.

You get the better processor and the premium package, 5 years support. IMO these trade blows and it depends what you want or need in a phone. It's good to have a new option.

To me, the most important parts of a phone are the camera and battery. That makes the SE a downgrade from my 3a probably, at best a sidegrade. If I wanted to spend more than $400 on a phone though I'd look at iPhone before the Pixel flagship. Non google or apple phones are a nonstarter for me due to inferior support and camera.

IOS,Acetronaut,1106,"I literally picked iOS because I liked it’s interface more than Androids. They do NOT need to “update the look”. Why do people get “bored” of good design? You know what happens when people constantly want a “updated look”. You end up getting the perfect, new modern, updated look. And then the next update they rip it away, with the newest, perfect, modern, updated look. And you absolutely hated it because it was already perfect before and the only reason they changed it was “for the sake of having something different” which is always the worst reason to do something.

People loved windows 7, which looked a lot like the ones before it, obviously heavily improved. 8 looked nothing like it because MS was trying something new and people hated it. Windows 10 went back to being reminiscent of Win7. 

Chrome on iOS used to be perfect, it had great functionality and was practical and worked. Then they updated it, had a whole new look, and half the features are missing, or things just feel incomplete now, and the interface flows way less. It was near perfect before. I loved it, I have literally switched back to Safari since they updated it though. 

This applies to hardware too. People were upset the “iPhone 11 looked the same as before” well duh, we just got a brand new chassis for the X, but apparently I heard from others that that didn’t count. Why? I can’t figure it out. The home button is gone, the screen is full now, and there’s a notch, but apparently that’s still identical to the 8 according to them, and that new chassis meant nothing, and people STILL want a new redesign after getting that one just recently. But phones are so slick and simple now that what more could you do? It was streamlined over the years that anything else now would be backwards. 

Tl;dr: I hate when people ask for a “new look” to something that’s already been iterated and perfected on, specifically things that totally do not need it. I don’t care if you’re getting bored, UIs aren’t supposed to be super interesting or attention grabbing. If anything, the UI should be designed that you don’t notice it.

I typically upgrade every year, so I don't really look at total cost, I look at cost over the year. With carrier deals I could've paid $240 over the year for an 11, or $150 for the LG. I'm not rich, but $90 isn't a huge deal. But $90 more for that 11 panel?

IOS,sewersidesquad,375,"There's a Play store. So there is one place to get all your apps.

You don't need a ""tool"" to back up your phone at all. All your contacts and apps are saved to your Google account. Your files aren't locked into apps, so you simply take the files you want to keep safe and that's it. 

It's not the amount of customizations, it's what you can and cannot control. Well for me personally. 
Everyone had their own needs. don't get me wrong, Apple does plenty of things right, but they just cannot compete with the simplicity of Android. Just to give you a few examples of things that complicate life on Apple:


1. Notifications. They never group accordingly and clearing them is a multi step approach. Sometimes the clear all button doesn't appear and they are not grouped making it confusing and difficult to see what is going on at a glance, which defeats the very purpose of the notification screen.
Sometimes apps take very long to open after touching their notification card and often they won't even open to that specific message or email and you just opened and now you've lost the notification to find it.
Compare that to Android which groups and clears easily and even allows you to reply from the notification shade directly, without needing to open the app.


2. File management. I got very used to browsing Reddit or other sites, seeing a picture or video I liked, then simply saving it to my device. This is very different on Apple. Everything just gets dumped into your camera roll and iOS cannot download in different formats, which means your videos are almost always poor quality GIFs. It also doesn't do webms.
Further complicateling things is the fact that some apps create albums for your pics and vids while other don't. Trying to manage how these folders are structures is a nightmare. You want to show a friend a video from last week, so you have to scroll through 100 memes from last night just to find your personal video in your recents folder. Which means you have to periodically separate stuff you save into the appropriate albums.
Compare this to Android - See video you like? Download to folder of your choice. Any format, any quality. One click, done. Need to access it later? Simply go to your gallery and find it neatly stacked away in said folder.


3. Multi-tasking. If you want to download or upload something, you have to wait and watch it or else it will stop the process from carrying on in the background. Some apps support multi-tasking, some don't. Very frustrating. Especially in a world of 4k 60fps video recording. Uploading a large file to share becomes tedious.
Compared to Android, do your thing and Forget about it. A progress bar notification will appear and you can go about your day using your phone normally.


4. Navigation. Apple likes to keep things simple, and for visual and layout, they get full marks. But the single button or swipe navigation system can be confusing. Yes, in theory it sounds simple. Just one button to go home and double tap to bring up recents. But going back to the previous screen needs a swipe or a chevron, sometimes one or the other is available, then it changes for media which requires a swipe down. I'll often try swiping from left and it doesn't work, then I see a chevron, the depending on what screen is open, brimging up a context menu is different...
So yes, in theory, one button, but in reality, you have to constantly analyse the context of the screen you're in to decide what to do and often, the gesture don't work. Compared to Android, where the back button is constant and predictable with context menus being universal long press. No confusion.

5. Home screen management. While Apple pioneered the home screen, the rise of apps and functionality of smartphones necessitates a simpler home screen. Everything is cluttered and dumped on your home screen which means you need to constantly arrange and rearrange apps and remember their positions. With Android, the app drawer is the dump of all your apps and your homescreen can be clutter free. I had at most 10 apps positioned wherever I needed then, no auto arranged grid to annoy me. The extra screen real estate can be used for things like 'at a glance' or any other widget. If you need to find an app, swipe up to see them all in your drawer and type to search. No need for spotlight to search your wlentire phone and net.

6.Default apps and software. Android has always been ahead here. Asking you each and every time which app you would like to associate with that task/link/file type. You can also just click always open with this app to avoid the message altogether. Sometimes opening a specific thing with a specific app is difficult on iOS.

7. Sharing. Airdrop is nice and I wish Android had a similar feature, but there is more to the world than just Apple products. Sometimes I want to receive things from my work PC or an Android phone. I need a 3rd party app to do that. Android can share and receive from anything anywhere.


These are just some of the things that complicate life on Apple ecosystem. But even with all these flaws, the performance, reliability and polish of iOS keeps me here. It has always been premium quality since inception, whereas Android only got to this level of polish with Android 9 and 10.

I'm thoroughly impressed with my new XR though and try to find workarounds to the things that annoy me. A lot of improvements have come about sinve my iPhone 4s days.

IOS,Acetronaut,1106,"I agree they could improve things, fix things that are clunky, etc. but the idea of wanting a whole UI overhaul? What are the things that stand different OSs apart. Features? UI? What else, that’s mostly it, because “features” covers so much. But if you change your UI, then you could potentially be changing some of the very reasons people like your program. Windows 8, I think, was very technically advanced, people just hated it because of the aesthetic. 

I agree with you that “iOS was conceived at a time when no one ever conceived that users would be using as many apps as we are today,” and that this does need fixing. Nested folders (definitely), maybe allowing gaps between icons, it would definitely feel more like a desktop then. But I hope they don’t make an “all programs” screen. I like the home screen of iOS better than Android. 

I do agree that individual parts of the UI can still be updated, I didn’t mean to imply it was already perfect (I know I used to word perfect before but I’ll try to re-explain so I can clarify myself). I just think the entire UI should not get an “updated look”. Changing specific parts about it, or updating them, is fine. Obviously I do think things should get better and improve, but scrapping your UI and making a new one, for the sake of “people want an updated look”, and not for “We should update the app system because we designed this over 15 years ago,” is where I have issue. Please, yes, update and upgrade things that need updating. But **updating something** ***for the sake of a “refreshed, updated look”***, is something I personally disagree with. If you’re getting bored of good UX design, then it’s kinda doing it’s job right? It’s successfully connecting you to whatever high end programs or whatever the user is trying to do, without being intrusive. In my personal opinion, as I said before, I think a UI should not be flashy or intrusive or in your face. If the user wants a new UI because the current one isn’t flashy enough, then damn, you’ve already got the perfect UI. Now if they want a new UI because features are missing and/or broken, that’s totally different lol. 

I hope you get my point, the big idea is basically, updating because you need to is great! Updating things just because “people got bored” is kinda dumb (in my opinion, obviously, there are people out there who disagree, but I just don’t understand when people say “Yeah, I think they need to update the look, I’m kinda bored of seeing the same thing over and over”, because to me, unless there is something wrong with the UI, I barely think about). If it’s doing it’s job correctly and I don’t have any issues with it, then yes, I prefer if I don’t even notice it. I want the UI to blend into the background and I should even notice I’m using it. A good interface you shouldn’t have to think about. 

As for the app thing you mentioned, I agree with that 100%, that component needs, and should be updated, do I think that means the looks and UI also needs to be updated/overhauled? No, I don’t think so. Any fix to the app system should be able to work with current systems and be integrated into it. It shouldn’t need UI rewriting to add stuff like that, and it could totally be added in an unobtrusive way. Like when they added folders years ago. They weren’t there at first, but when they added them in, they fit in just right as if they were always there.",0,neutral,"Main object: UI design and user interface of iOS and Android

I got on ebay and bought a bunch of Moto X's (2013) and have been using them exclusively for years. They're 4.7"" -- it's the perfect display size, and the glass isn't so narrow that that it flexes. They're tough phones, just old as hell. I religiously sit on them in my back pocket while crawling under houses and haven't broken the glass on a single one that way. Lost a few of them off a ladder, and one fell in a sewer grinder... those are 100% my fault. But a mile-long glass phone that bends when the slightest flex is applied is a 100% design flaw.

My main gripes about the phone is all the hardware except for the fast processor. I mean even the battery is really underwhelming. Its even hard for me to believe this, but there are $200 androids with hole punch display, 3x the battery, and comparable cameras. 
              It is true that software is important, thus the SE 2 even having a market. This is similar to pixel phones, all the experience/camera, mediocre hardware. The thing about 3+ years is that most people will upgrade every 3 years. If people are upgrading every 5 years, it just doesn't make sense to go from a lagging old smartphone to another old feeling smartphone. It makes more sense to upgrade to at least a midrange (iphone 11) or something higher end. 
             If form factor and pricing is the issue, there are phones out there like the Galaxy s10e and pixel 3a. Same goes for the cameras. I personally believe the 3a has a better camera over the SE 2. These phones can also be found for half the price of the SE 2. 
             Sorry for the long rant, I just believe the SE 2 is inferior to many android phones on the market currently. While there is a market for the phone, it is very specific and niche. This is especially true for people considering the used market.",2,negative,"Main object: Android

My friend let me try his newer gen scanner out and I think they are great. Though that is not the case on my Oneplus 6t 🙂. I personally still prefer the inscreen over dedicated fingerprint sensors on the back as I don't have to reach around the phone. This is definitely a big plus on the SE 2. And face ID (or whatever its actually called) is found on the pixel 4 lineup. Basically, the solid phone with simple features and nornal bezels you describe is the pixel 4s. But yea, most phone makers in general go for aesthetics. Thin bezels really do make you enjoy looking at the screen though (with a exception to accidental touches). I also wish phones still had their headphone jacks.
     
                Where I most disagree with you is on high refresh displays and battery life. While initially the 90 hz may seem trivial, you will never want to go back once you try it out. It would be hard for me to go back to 60 hz on my gaming monitor. Also, I think basically all high end phones have amazing battery life. What I find odd is that cheap androids seem to have even greater battery capacitys, contrary to iphone's budget SE 2.

On Visible, you need two months of service for them to give you the $200 prepaid card and the phone is only $385 to begin with. However, I believe the phone comes entirely unlocked. All you really have to do is pay $25 for the first month and $40 for the second and you get the phone. That’s a total cost of $450 minus $200... $250 to get a phone that should be unlocked (once they are back in stock).

It was the first iPhone to have 3 camera modules which included night mode in the main lens. The battery was imo the best of all iPhones even the 14PM which I have right. It was the first iPhone to have IP68 which already beat the competition rating it to 4 meters instead of 1,5 submersion like Samsungs, Sony etc… the oled display had all the issues resolved from the X and Xs, was bright and had HDR. It was also the last iPhone with rounded edges which I loved. With all the iPhones I had, the 11PM is clearly saved in my memory as my favorite.

IOS,PhoenixRisingtw,0,"I “accidentally” tried iPhone after my Samsung Galaxy got damaged and I borrowed my sister's 4/4s (don't know exactly). 

It wasn't the newest at that point and had a cracked screen and a selfie cam, but it was my first experience with iOS and I started loving it. After using it for a couple of weeks, I knew I'm getting an iPhone next. 

So officialy my first iPhone was the 6. Then later I swapped it with a friend for a 6s Plus, had that for a little while and then bought a 7 Plus just as the 8 was released, and I had that for 5.5 years. It's still going strong, but I recently switched to an 11. 

I used the 7 Plus without any case and only had screen protector in the beginning. It fell down on the ground many times, but no cracks on the display and only some cosmetic stuff on the body. That phone feels indestructible for me. I don't understand how people crack their iPhones, the newer ones should have even tougher screens etc. Maybe I've just been lucky. 

**So for me the 7 Plus is the best iPhone**,  because it's just been so reliable and I got so much value out of it. It never let me down. It could easily be used for another year or so, but my mom had a spare 11 so I thought why not. But for a phone that's now 6 and a half years old it's pretty amazing. And I even bought it second hand on eBay (in mint condition).

So my experience with iPhones has been excellent, they never let me down and have been reliable devices. And I am confident that if I were to buy the newest top of the line model, I could use it for like 6 years (I bought the 7 Plus when it was already 1 year old and my biggest gripe is that it didn't get iOS 16, if I bought it when it came out I could get another year of use on the latest iOS).",1,positive,"Main object: iPhone

I believe it's time for a new phone. I have my eye on a 13 Pro, but I keep hearing these arguments that iOS is very limited. I don't understand that. I use my phone like an average user: social media, texting, taking pictures, I even rarely play games. Heck, I am pretty sure that 13 Pro's battery would last 2 days for me.

So, I am not interested in installing some ""super cool"" launchers, widgets, changing icons, installing anything that isn't in the AppStore.

I've also heard that iPhone apps take more space than Androids. Currently I have a 64GB phone and it is **more than enough** for me. I am saying this because 13 Pro base version comes with 128 GB.

Sentiment: Negative",negative
IOS,di_verge_nt,868,"I had been an android user for years until I switched to iOS 2 months back. Here are some of the annoyances of iOS:

1. The way iOS handles notifications is inferior to Android. It shows the latest texts from a person at the top, so I’ve to read multiple texts from a person from the bottom up. Pretty clumsy in my opinion and replying to texts through notifications is not as simple as in Android. Say what you want, iOS is still struggling to match Android in this aspect.

2. One of the biggest turn offs is the File management in iOS. Since iOS doesn’t have shared storage for apps, it gets complicated when you need to transfer different file types. For example, if you want to transfer a video from your computer to an iPhone, you can’t copy the file to the Downloads folder or your internal storage like in android directly. You need to have an app that can open that file type installed on your iPhone and then using iTunes, you can copy that file to the permitted space for that app. I’ve heard people bring up the security reason for this kind of hassle, but this is way more time consuming for a simple task. The whole iTunes software thing to transfer files is not comforting for me.

3. The customisation. I did play around with launchers and custom icons and custom ROMs in Android. But I don’t really miss that because I haven’t got the time like before. But the customisation options in iOS are highly limiting. To set a custom ringtone, you need to use GarageBand to import your custom ringtone, edit it, save it and only then will it appear as an option to be set as your ringtone. Rearranging of apps is a pain in iOS in my opinion because while rearranging apps, they have this affinity to stick to the top left corner relatively from where they are moved from. In Android, there are spots in a grid where I can place the app and I can do it anywhere in a 3x4 or a 4x5 or a 5x6 grid. Widgets are not interactable. Suppose you have a to-do list widget and you want to add something to the widget, you can’t add it directly through the widget. You have to open the app to add an item. At least you can scroll inside the widget lol.

4. The Keyboard, for me has been by far the most infuriating thing about iOS. The autocorrect is thrash. If you want to use curse words, you need to add every single curse word you use to the Text Replacement menu. You can’t adjust the keyboard height. I gave up on third-party keyboard because they are severely limited in iOS. Gboard on iOS is very limited in functionality. I don’t use a lot of swipe typing on the iOS keyboard because it’s not very good at predicting what I want to type half the time.

5. Unlike what most users believe, sideloading apps is possible on iOS without jailbreaking through AltStore. I have sideloaded YouTube++ which is basically YouTube Vanced but for iOS. The pissing off thing is, you can’t sideload more than 2 apps if you’re using a non-developer Apple account. Plus you need to connect your phone to a computer every 7 days so that AltStore can refresh your sideloaded apps. If you don’t do it, the sideloaded app will go offline and you can’t use it. Nice one, Apple.

Other minor annoyances which affect daily usage:

1. The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggle don’t turn off for good when toggled on and off through the control centre. You have to go to the settings app to turn it off for good.

2. Battery percentage is not shown in the status bar from iPhone X onwards. 

3. If you use the default clock app for alarms, you can’t dismiss a reoccurring alarm just for today. You have to disable the whole thing if you want it to skip for today. 

4. The App Store is mostly apps with a subscription model. I get that the developers need to earn from apps but android has so much more options than iOS in this regard.

5. There’s no universal back gesture in iOS and the existing back gesture is not very intuitive to use in my opinion considering you need to swipe from the left edge to the right.

6. If you want to dismiss a notification in a single swipe, you need to swipe from the right edge to the left edge in a longgggg swipe. 

7. Apple gives you 5GB of iCloud backup storage and by default all apps sync to it. It’s like they want you to fill it up as fast as possible and pay for more storage. Why can’t Apple just allow WhatsApp to sync to Google drive like in Android? 

8. You can’t reject a call from a person who is in your contacts list. You can either accept or silence it. Like why? Just why?

9. If I’m using a Bluetooth audio device and I get a call, I need to change the call audio output to the Bluetooth device everytime. I’ve noticed it automatically switches sometimes but 95% of the time, I need to do it manually.",24,negative,"Main object: iOS

Some websites may not work properly on webkit, you don't have any choice here (90% of the time, webkit will work just fine). Safari extensions are limited, i really miss firefox on android.

3. Had to go through lot of steps just to set up a ringtone. Yes, you can pay and use ringtones from their ringtone store which is easy, but I wanted something which was not in their store.

iOS keyboard (and this is true even if you install a 3rd party keyboard) is hot fucking garbage.  Every way that I preferred to customize my Android keyboard (give me a single-press comma key and the ability to put the numbers on the numbers level in a grid instead of a row FFS) is completely and totally nerfed away.  And long press to get one of your 26 most-used symbols?  GTFOH with that fancy-pants shit.  You'll hunt through alternate keyboards until you find your semicolon like the peasant you are.

Second, the (again) nerfed homescreen 'customization' is indeed quite vexing.  Why oh why can't I just decide I want a certain app to be in the upper right, or bottom left, corner, regardless of whether or not there are other icons on that screen?

6 things is the total of big issues (no nitpicks) I had with my switching.

1. Biggest one was my music, 40% of my local music is in FLAC and Apple doesn’t have any solid FLAC support in the Music app and iTunes, so I have to convert that mess to ALAC.

2. Whatsapp backup being gone, 9 years of chat history gone, and while this is a Whatsapp issue, it did make the jump to iOS even harder.

3. The whole files system in a nutshell, I could rant about it for a few hours, fact is that on Android it has the same freedom as on my Windows desktop, on iOS it is by comparison much more restricted for someone that did transfer the files between PC and phone A LOT. 

4. Sorting icons on home screen, “dear Apple, just give me the option to put my icons the way I want it and not always from left to right, from top to bottom”

5. Photo app, feels way too restricted (even worse than Google Photos, but I always used stock gallery of my phone)

6. Notification centre, works much more productive on Android compared to iOS.

1) file system. Can’t copy anything in the storage like how you can use the android storage as a USB drive. You can only see the photos folder when you connect the phone to the computer and can copy only from phone to computer. 

Also, it shows all photos together. No separate folders for WhatsApp media etc. 

2) No pause button in video recording. 

3) if you use call forwarding:  can either turn if on or off. No options like forward when not reachable/ when not answered/ when busy etc. 

4) the photo albums in phone are great, only thing missing is a separate section to see only photos taken in your phone. Can get away with it, can search “iPhone 12 pro max” for eg. in search and it shows all photos taken with that phone. Other albums categories are great, WhatsApp, people , places, selfies, Live Photos, potrait, and many more.

5) can’t send files/photos from iPhone to computer/android device using Bluetooth. And of course can’t send anything to iPhone too via Bluetooth.

IOS,EdgarDrake,620,"As a long time iPhone owner that develops Android apps as daily job, the biggest constraint for me is the lack of ""back button"". In iOS, most of the back navigation can be achieved using swipe navigation (which fits me because I use my left hand for handling phone).

However, some navigation in app prevents using back swipe because the screen need to show quit prompt, which means I need to reach the visible back button using my thumb. This kind of pattern usually exists in 3rd party app. However, some Apple integrated apps also do this, like Shortcuts (automation), Apple Store full screen modal, Contacts edit mode, etc. Some modal use swipe down to dismiss for easy dismiss pattern. However, if the modal has pull to refresh behavior (like Apple Store my account modal), swipe down not from the top bar handle would not dismiss the modal, instead doing content refresh.

This behavior is super easy to handle in Android, since my thumb always near the physical (or on-screen) back button. No need for such thing as using iOS reachability or so.

Mind you, I use iPhone mini, and I still think that the screen is still too big for simple reachability. Android wins the convenience and consistency of doing back navigation here.",3,negative,"Main object: iOS and Android

I find that iOS is much more limited on how you can do things and if the OS does not give you what you would like, there is no alternative way.

Most annoying example I have come across; you can only have snooze on alarms to be 9 minutes. Nothing else. Applea infinite wisdom has told that this is the only choice as it was in the anchient times with mechanical clocks and no alternative alarm is reliable as they have to be actually open in the background. So yeah, just 9min snooze. 

Also, I use quite a bit of automation and the shortcuts app from Apple. There is a option to trigger on ”waking up”. But that triggers only when you actually stop the alarm that should wale you. So when not waking up to the alarm, you can’t trigger anything else.

Just a few and the OS is full of these. On Android I could get apps that would handle so many more advanced situations and now it’s not possible.

Pros:
1. iOS is so much stable, smooth, and simple operating system to use (I hate that there are so many ads I’m viewing on my Redmi and the lags)
2. The ecosystem! After buying my iPhone, I also purchased an iPad, and I have a flawless workflow. I can copy on my iPad and paste on my phone, take calls from my iPad, focus mode syncs with my iPad, continue all my work from the iPhone to the iPad, etc. 
3. AirDrop! Half of my friends are using iPhone, so it’s so easy and fast to share files with them via AirDrop instead of sending files with WhatsApp or gdrive
4. Stable apps! I don’t know, but since I’m using iPhone, I’ve rarely noticed and bug on apps or lagging (except WhatsApp)
5. So many features that are so useful but not gimmicky like focus mode, text scan, magnifier, tap to zoom, iCloud private relay, Hide my email, keychain, and so on!
5. The camera, I might have one 12mp camera, but it is so awesome, and I can always trust that the photos and videos taken from that camera will be good, just like what I want. 
6. Maybe it depends, but they're more good and well-designed iPhone cases than Android, so that's a plus for me. 

Cons:
1. Battery. I feel like the battery on the Android is much better than the iPhone, but I heard the opposite happened in 13 pros. 
2. Storage. Before, I had 32GB, and it was just okay with me for 3 years, but now 128GB has already been fulfilled in 1 year, and I blame it for the good camera, haha.
3. Closed ecosystem. I missed that I can install applications from outside the app store that I want on Android. Much personalization that I can have with Android because, in iOS, it is limited. But this isn't a problem because since using my iPhone, I'm more focused on completing tasks than spending time choosing an interesting theme or launcher, haha.
4. When you're using Windows, you can't sync your phone with my phone apps, just like with Android, and transferring data from iPhone to Windows, vice-versa, is frustrating.

Some customizations that are simple on Android (setting a music sleep timer, customizing your home screen layout, etc.) are unnecessarily complicated (the Shortcuts app is great, but some things are natively or easier done on Android, whereas on iOS, the solution is ""oh, create a shortcut""). You also can't lay out icons and widgets on your home screen as you like - they MUST be next to each other, unlike on Android

That said, iOS is...alright. I appreciate the attempt at simplicity, but some random bugs here and there make me question if it's really worth it. I do like the opt-in on tracking though.

Additionally, you iTunes is required to sync music, and you cannot browse the phone's file system (except for photos/videos). I used to use MusicBee to sync with my Android phone, but now I can't :( Basically, everything is closed down to the user and must be managed the way Apple wants you to.

Advantage of keeping my S9+:
Edge control (I can control back, home, task view, Multi window etc. on the side of the screen. I almost never have to reach more than half side of the screen to control things on my phone)
YouTube without ads: YouTube vanced app is basically the official YouTube app without ads. I'm sure you can't install anything on an iPhone outside app store unless you jailbreak, and I don't wanna get into that.
Faster animations, customizable shortcuts: I can control animation speeds and add shortcuts to make anything generally more faster to do on my phone than an iPhone.
Much allowance in controlling files: like file explorer on windows, I can control files easier (for example, I can download a movie and its subtitles and play it without trouble)
The watch: I have a galaxy watch active 2 that I don't know if it will work well with an iPhone 
Advantage of moving to an iPhone:
Pretty much every single one of my friends have it: I always get called gay cuz I have a Samsung lol
iMessage (plus FaceTime): I don't really know why iPhone users find iMessage much more useful than normal messaging cuz obviously I have never used it, but it seems way more popular
Clearer and prettier interface: just my opinion, I think the interface looks better.

I guess I'm just trying to be ""one of them"", and I am pretty sure I won't gain any more productivity if not find my phone less useful.

IOS,Abedbob,2540,"I’m very familiar with both Android and iOS, but I prefer iOS. Both have all the features I use on a regular basis, though i just find myself liking iOS more. Here are some of my reasons: 

-	iMessage is great. It’s free as long as you have data and there are tons of cool features built in like games, stickers, message effects, read receipts, etc. Not a deal breaker for me but nice to have.
-	iOS has great tools built in for showing you what apps use location services and limiting apps usage of your location individually 
-	iOS also has a very in depth battery management tool. It shows apps that use the most battery while on screen and in the background
-	For me, I prefer the design language of iOS much more. In my opinion, Android’s Material Design is starting to show its age 
-	I have to use a Mac for school, and features like Handoff and AirDrop are super convenient. Apple also has a cloud based clip board so you can copy text from your phone and then paste it on your Mac or vice versa.

There is one feature that really needs to be added to iOS though and that is T9 dialing. The phone app even has letters on the number pad, which currently (and never have) serve no purpose whatsoever as far as I can tell.

Edit: I forgot to mention that Apple typically supports their devices for longer than most other manufacturers. The iPhone SE from 2016 is still getting major software updates and is rumored to still be supported in iOS 14 as well. iOS is also very optimized, and runs smoothly even on older devices.",29,positive,"Main object: iOS

You can do this on iPhone, too. Swipe from the left edge to go back. Swipe from the bottom to go home. Swipe from the bottom and pause for a split second to open the app switcher. Swipe horizontally along the bar at the bottom of the screen to switch apps without opening the app switcher. (Assuming you get a modern iPhone with Face ID.)

> YouTube without ads: YouTube vanced app is basically the official YouTube app without ads. I'm sure you can't install anything on an iPhone outside app store unless you jailbreak, and I don't wanna get into that.

I have YouTube without ads on iOS, but I pay for it. Safari has ad blockers though. Maybe they work for YouTube in the browser? 

> Faster animations

The animations are already pretty fast on iOS. I can’t imagine most of them being much faster. You do have the option to “reduce motion”, which changes most animations to just fades, but that’s the extent of that customization. iOS had insane customization for other things, though, when you dig into the Accessibility settings, which are intended for anyone, not just disabled or old people.

> customizable shortcuts: I can control animation speeds and add shortcuts to make anything generally more faster to do on my phone than an iPhone.

iOS has the Shortcuts app built-in, which is very powerful. I don’t know if this is equivalent to what you’re referring to. You can program custom shortcuts or download from others. You can string together actions from many apps and services, as well as plenty of on-device actions and settings. Shortcuts can then be executed via Siri, widget, share sheet in apps, AssistiveTouch menu, or customizable buttons on the home screen. 

> Much allowance in controlling files: like file explorer on windows, I can control files easier (for example, I can download a movie and its subtitles and play it without trouble)

iOS has a Files app and lets you download files from the web. I don’t see why you couldn’t download a movie and watch it on iOS.

You might be surprised how powerful iPhones are. There are tons of power-user features in iOS that most people don’t know about.

I’ll paste my basic iOS tips below to give you an idea of some of the useful gestures and hidden features you might find useful that many people don’t know about.

**iOS basics:**
- Long-press everything for context menus, content previews, and shortcuts to various actions. Apps, items in lists, links, most buttons in Safari, everything
- Swipe from the left edge of the screen to go back in many apps
- Swipe horizontally along the bottom of the screen to quickly switch apps without opening the app switcher or re-open the last-used app from the home screen (works on modern iPhones with Face ID)
- Swipe photos and videos down to close them in many apps
- Tap the status bar to quickly reach the top of a page
- Long-press the scroll bar, then drag it up and down to quickly scroll. You can flick it down to quickly reach the bottom of a page

**Text editing basics:**
- Long-press the space bar to enter trackpad mode to easily move the cursor
- While in trackpad mode, tap with a second finger to start selecting text
- Or drag the insertion point itself to move it
- While dragging the insertion point, you can still use the keyboard with another finger to quickly type characters in multiple places
- Double-tap text to select a word
- Drag from the second tap without lifting your finger to select multiple words
- Triple-tap text to select a sentence
- Quadruple-tap text to select a paragraph
- Drag the ends of the selected area to expand the selection
- Tap the insertion point (or next to it if there’s an empty space) to open the text-selection menu (also opens automatically when selecting words) to find the Select All action
- Swipe horizontally in the text-selection menu to page through it without having to tap the small left and right arrows
- The Look Up action in the text-selection menu is really powerful. It includes a dictionary, thesaurus, and tons of other content related to the item that’s selected, plus a shortcut to search the web with the selected text

**Three-finger editing gestures:**
- Swipe left to undo (this and the next one also work for undoing or redoing basic actions in some apps)
- Swipe right to redo
- Pinch in to copy
- Pinch in again to cut
- Pinch out to paste
- Tap to show menu with these commands

**Bonus typing tips:**
- Double-tap space bar to type a period
- Drag finger from shift or symbol key to desired character, then lift finger; keyboard will switch back to previous state automatically. Super fast to type commas, question marks, etc.
- Or hold shift or symbol key with one finger while typing with the other. Lifting first finger will revert the keyboard
- Double-tap shift key to enable caps lock
- Long-press various keys for alternative symbols. For example, ° on the 0 key, • on the - key, etc.",47,neutral,"Main object: Comparison between iOS and Android

IOS,OMG_NoReally,21121,"The biggest thing I have experienced moving from the S9+ to the 11 is the overall smoothness and consistency of the iOS. The cliche of the iPhone is that """"it just works!"" but it's true. It really does just work.

I am also a huge fan of Airdrop. It's not perfect but it works 99% of the time and it's so easy to send across files quickly to other iOS users.

Also, once you get into the iOS ecosystem, you'll notice that everything works so seamlessly with each other it's almost like magic. I got an Apple TV and setting it up was as simple as pointing my iPhone towards the Apple TV. That's it. It auto configured the settings, user accounts, password, etc., on its own.

As far as I know there's no way to control animation speed, you either have animations active or not. for the customisable shortcuts it depends on what do you want to do but there's a preinstalled app called ""shortcuts"" that let you make a lot of useful things with and even without siri. there is a file app preinstalled on iOS but its not similar to windows at all (its similar to Mac file system) but you still don't have access to all the files of all the application etc but if you only want to download movies there's no problem doing that.

I don't think you should switch to iPhone only because your friends call you ""gay""; if you're still satisfied with your phone there's no motivation to switch. 

I'm European ad here iMessage is not that big of a deal (I basically never used it) so I don't really know anything about it. 

lastly as an iOS user that has had many secondary androids phone over the years, for my experience, I can say that iOS is generally less buggy than android but it's obviously not perfect and you can still encounter some lag and slowdowns (In some rare instances).

IOS,anurodhp,29406,"Other people can explain other things. iMessage is hard one for android users because you think its just chat. Android is stuck in 90s SMS land (actually based on tech from 1984) and cant do much more that really basic text and simple media in 3gpp format (think nokia candy bar phones).

iMessage is an end to end encrypted chat system without limitations from last century.  Apple cant and isn't reading your messages. This is something google blocks in their programs ([https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/googles-allo-sends-wrong-message-about-encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/googles-allo-sends-wrong-message-about-encryption)).

You can send videos and pictures >2MB which is the limit on android phones (actually in the us it is about 1MB because some carriers have smaller limits).  

Android phones also have a 90s style group message system where it is actually just an email mailing list. You can't add and remove people, name your group etc. 

You can see when someone is typing a message

You can see when someone has received a message

 You can see when someone has read your message (this may be why your friends are annoyed)

iMessage is an eco system in itself and the closest thing to the kinds of chat based  social media/web  you see in Asia.  In chat you can play games, buy things, make payments and interact anonymously (and securely) with businesses. As it continues to develop it will be a replacement for phone calls and the web for support and e-commerce.

IOS,Unknown,0,"**TL;DR:** >!A 2013 iPhone 5S still runs great for day to day work related stuff; at the moment of writing this comment!<

*Short backstory*

I had Android and a Windows Phone about 6 or 7 years back. What I noticed was that those phones got sluggish each time a small update came by, or just by normal/daily use (Whatsapp, messages, Mail). My partner had an iPhone 4C - and I got in love with how fast/responsive iOS was. So, she encouraged me to get an iPhone.

It's how it all started,

I got an iPhone 5s, used for 3 years (was already \~1y old at the time of purchase). Had no problems with it.

Had it switched to an SE because my mother (55 years then) needed a new phone. She was using an Android Samsung something\_model and she was always complaining on how complicated it is to use it. She got in love with the 5S due to its OS ease of use.

Used said SE up until the XS/R came out and current employer offered to get me a new one with a major discount. Got the XS.

Gave my mum the former SE and took her 5S back to be used as a separate phone for the work number.

*End of backstory.*

&#x200B;

Currently using the 5S (released in 2013, iOS 12.4) for work and the XS as a personal phone.

I'm amazed of how fast the 5S still is, the only moment of sluggishness is when it's cold booted, afterwards it's working great. Using it mainly for Mail, messages and calls; with some additional apps I need to run that are work related.

&#x200B;

I would say the one thing that matters - at least for me - is that the phones will still run great even after several years; unlike what I've seen in my previous Android device and some random colleagues with S9's.",3,positive,"Main object: iPhone (iOS)

Also don’t be surprised when third party accessories stop working after an update just cause. I just had an hdmi to lighting cable stop working after the latest update.

IOS,Dash------,379,"I might be in a position to give some advice. 1 year ago I switched first to S9 then S10 then to OP7pro and tried Pixel. OnePlus was my daily driver though after using it parallel with S10 for two months. I am back on latest iPhone since a few days.

First of all, s9 was not even close in performance to iphone x or s10 for that matter. Shitty fingerprint reader on the back compared to face id, slow phone etc. With the last years phones the whole thing became another ball game  So any upgrade you make it will blow S9 out of the water.

What you will miss? Well first thing was...oh shit I cannot have my calendar on top screen together with weather, and I cannot put icons on the bottom of massive screen on iphone without figuring out which apps I do not use day to day so they are space fillers. Second, I got used to high refresh rate screen, so iPhone currently does not keep up with my scrolling - but no doubt in a month I will get used to it. Super fast charging? Nope. Youtube (buy premium on iphone) or maps in a small window while doing other stuff? nope. Download torrent and transfer it directly to USB to plug into tv? Also no go. Want that sweet app not released in your region? Tough shit - no sideloading. AOD? Nope. Customize stuff like important notifications going thorough DND? Nope again.

I use google assistant for my smart home - outfitted everything with google speakers+smartthings so thats no longer a problem but it is something to consider. Homekit together with Siri, not really in the same league.

So why am I back? 11 pro max for full price is not worth it in my opinion, but now the price has dropped on second hand, bringing it on pair with current android gen released.

You will love:

\- Camera that takes good photos ""all the time"". All phones up there make great photos in some circumstances but fail to deliver consistently. Low light photos? Hit & Miss (except pixel maybe but its a joke without wide angle).

\- Face ID: the best was OP7pro fingerprint sensor (s10 was shit in comparison), but FaceID is just so much better and does not break your workflow.

\- iMessage (I guess that is a very US thing but I am including it here even though for me it didn‘t matter). For my area whatsapp and FB messenger doe the trick.

\- Updates: Samsung will be late in the first year and worse in every year after.

\- Apple Pay: it‘s the best integration, period. Need to quickly change cards on the fly without going through apps and shit? done.

And surprisingly the most important one: Apple Watch. There is nothing that comes even close in reliability and functions that is on market. Want app experience with Google Pay? Enjoy the suffering and bugginess that is wearOS. Want basics done well, but lose on everything else? Galaxy watch was my choice that at least got notifications right. Apple Watch is single most impressive part of the iOS ecosystem. It was the other half of the reasons why I changed in the first place (why buy 1.5k€ phone if all I love is a watch?) and is a big reason why I am back.

Hope this helps :) And if you just won‘t use stuff like Apple Watch or Apple Pay...and don‘t do that many photos/are willing to put some more work into it...there is no reason not to go with something like OnePlus.",4,neutral,"Main object: Comparison between iOS and Android smartphones

The swipe to back function don't work in all apps and is media specific. 

Eg you are meant to swipe down to exit images and videos. Meaning on YouTube, you need to swipe the video down and swipe left to right to go back. On android it's just swipe left to right or right to left. 

And swift to left can be quite difficult for one hand use.

On android there's a persistent icon on top right for notifications, not on the iOS. Not really a major issue but i find it done a lot better on android. 

No manual camera control is annoying and the system prioritise its Apple photo app more than Google photo, which imo is much better at sorting files etc.

Siri also isn't as good as Google assistant for driving, Google assistant would read out your search results etc, not Siri.

Notification centre isn't as informative

The app library on the far right tab is decent, auto grouped and able to search BUT if you did not intend to be in that tab and swift up/down (minor movement) accidentally, it's quite a hassle to get back to other tabs because the system thought you scrolling for the right app.

Android widgets are just so much better than Apple, being able to resize and place in different area on screen etc. 

But at the end, it's more or less the same. It's just a smartphone with apps, you won't feel unfamiliar. But android definitely has so much more customisation that make it a tailored fit experience, and better if you like the Google ecosystem.",6,negative,"Main object: iOS and Android

What do I miss? good notification system including icons on top right corner, the ability to change icons, and the ability to sideload apps like memory editors and emulators. What I don't know if I missed was rooting. Any Android phone I got had to be rooted, but the whole rooting scene became more of a hassle than it was worth. 

Ultimately which phone you used is a matter of personal preference. 

Android has matured and it allows for superficial customization, but nothing major like they used to allow with rooting etc. It is up to each phone manufacturer what they want their vision of Android to be - like how Oneplus Samsung, Nothing, Asus etc. have their own Android skins. 

Conversely, iOS has allowed relatively more customization. The main appeal or intent of iOS is that you just need to accept the curated experience Apple wants you to have, which in turn should offer a more cohesive and polished user experience. There are many annoyances like with the terrible notification system, sometimes non-intuitive settings layout, etc., but not enough to turn you off from iOS. They are known to be relatively more conservative with innovations, preferring to provide unique and polished UX. 

There really isn't a 'better' one and down to which you prefer.  If you enjoy or want active control over your phone, then Android is the way to go. For me, I've reached a point in life where I want my technology to work in the background at my convenience, and accepted that Tim Apple will be the 'guide' for my phone. This may well be the complete opposite of what you want. and that's perfectly fine.",4,neutral,"Main object: Android

IOS,freakyxz,321,"10+ years on Android and switched to 14PM before 2 months.

Cons:
- No universal back gesture. And navigations at all. E.g. in YouTube you cannot use back gesture to close the video. 
- Notifications. 
- No background work allowed (with some exceptions), e.g. downloading file. You have to stare like an idiot.
- Keyboard. Used to it but it still sucks. I don’t know what’s the problem of Apple not adding number row. 
- call logs. Everything is stored there (I mean even a Teams call) and WE just got a history of 100+ logs. Hooray. 
- Dynamic Island. Gimmick to hide ugly “notch”. With Pro Max you can’t even interact with it one hand.
- Apps settings are in the Settings itself.
- I have AW as well. Although it’s far superior than any WearOS device, the thing that annoys me is that it cannot track a simple nap. Also there is no automatic sleep tracker. If you miss to start sleep focus you lose.
- 90% of the apps have subscriptions.
- Not much customisation as Android, but didn’t care when I was on Android and I don’t care now as well. 
- SoT. If you wanna know how much screen you squeeze from the battery you have to have 100% at the start of the day, else you have to do some basic math. 
- Lightning, but finally EU forced them to use USB-C.
- No volume sliders for different types. 
- I’m not into voice assistants and can’t say much about Siri, but fucking let me use CarPlay without having to have Siri activated and drain my battery for nothing.
- Swipe from top left for notifications, top right for control center. With big phone it’s hard. At least you can use back taps for that and somewhat helps.
- No Work mode. I miss that a lot.

Pros:
- Face ID. Ugly notch, but you basically don’t notice it it is working. I love it.
- Apps are better built and polished.
- iOS is smooth. My wife has S23+ still (I have switched from S23U) and although OneUI works great I can still see how much smoother iOS is. Anyway it’s expected when you have full control over hardware and software.
- long support and everyone gets the update the day Apple pushes it live. 
- Apple Watch (already said it)
- iPhones feel more premium and better built.
- MagSafe. Although I only use it for the stand in the car. 
- Far more/better support from third parties. 
- Apple Pay. 
- I love that the phone has Lidar sensor on the back as well. I’m using Measure app more than I have expected.

- notifications system. On iOS notifications basically disappear after you unlock the phone and have to look for them. If you have multiple notifications from one app and open one of them the rest is cleared front notification center

- status bar. Unless I open notification center I have absolutely no idea if there are any notifications waiting for me if I'm using the some app. Can't also quickly check what functions are active. I was wandering why my battery suddenly got so much worse. I turned on hotspot by an accident ans had no idea it was on because there was nothing signaling it.

- keyboard. There's no keyboard on iOS that even comes close to Gboard on Android

- not having to be so pixel perfect with taping. I feel like on iOS I have to be extremely precise with taps. On Android it was more forgiving and still recognizing what I wanted to tap.

IOS,Basdoderth,2040,"Recently changed from Xiaomi. I've used top Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Realme, Xiaomi phones. I've also used iOS in the past like back to iPhone 8. 

I got myself an iPhone 13 to re-experience iOS. 

iOS keyboard sucks and is light years away from Gboard on Android. You can't type fast enough. Believe me, you're gonna miss it. I've reduced my screen time because I hate iOS keyboard. Had to install Microsoft SwiftKey. 

You have to keep switching keyboard screens to find even comas and periods when in Android Gboard you can long press (not even long; you can take it to 300ms response time  which is super super fast) and you get all characters in the same keyboard screen. 

iOS swipe writing sucks, so you can't use your phone with one hand. Keyboard prediction also sucks. SwiftKey helps a bit but nothing compared to Gboard Android. 

Takes a long time to load. Many Androids charge in like 30 minutes. This iPhone takes 80 minutes to charge from 20 to 90. 

You can't use two apps at the same time. And boy how I miss that. 

You can't personalize ANYTHING. I do miss that. iOS doesn't  have nice widgets. They look good, but are useless. 

You can't even personalize your wallpaper without going to the hassle of going to Settings > Wallpaper > Add New One > Image. It's too much. I used to go to Photos > Set as Wallpaper. And that was it. In Android. 

It weights more. Sure. It feels and looks nice. But after some minutes writting this comment my hands feel tired. Or weights a lot. Even more with the protector case. I feel like iPhones are more to just stare at things than to write and do. I get tired easily. 

The battery drops really fast when you so something that requires graphics or video. It's distressing. 

At least on iPhone 13 you either have to have a too little screen sizing or a too big screen suzing that only my grandma would appreciate. There's no in-between. 

I feel like most settings are hidden or don't even exist. Everything is easier to configure in Android. 

You can't personalize icon size. You can't create super folders. There is a screen where everything is in a super folder by default but who uses it. It's at the end of the home screens, takes a long time to search what you want. I used to have all super folders in MIUI with my most useful apps and they looked better. 

It costs significantly more than my last Xiaomi and I think it's not worth it. I'll make sure to switch back to Android as soon as something happens to this iPhone. 

The only thing I appreciate is the user interface. It looks nice. Icons look nice. Screen is brighter. Some apps look nicer than in  Android.

In iOS, unless you jailbreak, the land for installing .ipa is just small and might be too much of a hassle

IOS,cmiller4642,26625,"Backwards compatibility with other companies’ products 

The downside and upside iOS is it honestly is Apple device locked. What I mean is that if you have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch, AirPods, Magic Keyboard, etc… you unlock the full “experience” of what your iPhone can truly do. This is something that Samsung phones don’t have to deal with.

Reading an online article on your iPad and want to continue reading it on the toilet in your iPhone? 100% a thing if you have both and use Safari. 

Listening to an album on Apple Music on your MacBook and have to go somewhere else? Pause it on your MacBook and resume it on your iPhone in the car. 

The experience Apple has put into their device integration is amazing and almost works like magic, however you can rack up a lot of money to get the hardware and are basically “married” to one company. Your iPhone becomes a spoke in a very large wheel. It’s the mobile device that pushes things to your other devices. You can easily answer texts on your Watch and iPad, AirDrop photos from your phone to your Mac with a press of a button, use your AirPods on every device seamlessly with 0 effort, etc…

The iPhone is honestly 1000x better if you have their other devices. The Galaxy can stand alone as a separate device. Do I regret my decision? Nope not at all. Does my wallet regret my decision? Probably. I ended up with an iPhone 14 Pro Max, M2 MacBook Air, M2 iPad Pro 11 Inch, AirPods Pro 2, a Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil, and a Series 7 Apple Watch (free with my carrier).

IOS,QuadrantNine,4706,"Two days into iOS, my general thoughts are:

Cons

- Notifications are handled so awkwardly. 

- My Garmin watch broadcasts all notifications to it and I can't pick and choose which apps I want to receive (unless I set a focus mode). I've been told that this most likely a Garmin problem and not a iOS problem, as in the Garmin devs haven't implemented anything to fix it yet. So my complaint might be moot.

- Not being able to put my apps wherever I want on the home screen. I have to use widgets to force everything where I want it to be.

- Deep levels of customization aren't really there, but this I can live without. (Just let me customize how I manage my notifications, that's all I ask for!)

- Lack of persistent back button / gesture. iOS does have it's own version of this but it requires more movement & doesn't work between apps. Honestly though, this isn't bothering me that much. It's made my phone usage a bit slower than normal but I don't think that that's a bad thing.


Pros

- Whole experience feels much smoother.

- I can use apps I've always wanted to try that weren't on Android.

- Focus modes are pretty cool. People have compared them to Android saying that Android has done it better, but I disagree. Using focus modes + automations I can set my home screen & notifications depending on different contexts in my life.

- Shortcuts & automations being built into the OS is very cool. I used to use Tasker on Android and although it can do more, it's awkward and clunky and after a while I just stopped using Tasker all together.

- I can set the charge limit to 80% to prolong the lifetime of the battery. I hear that Android has been doing this but I couldn't find it in my Pixel's settings (running Android 14), maybe I missed something.

- Face ID is ridiculously impressive. It feels like black magic.


Neither Good, nor Bad

- Keyboard feels different, but that's just because I'm used to a third party keyboard I was using on Android. I can adapt.

- The Dynamic Island feels imposing and I'm not really sure how useful it is outside of the camera & sensors. It's taking a bit to get used to after having the Pixel's hole-punch camera.

- The overall aesthetic feels different. The best description I can call it is ""playful"" especially with how the apps bounce around while editing the home screen. Not a bad thing, just different, especially since I was using Nova Launcher with a custom icon pack on Android.

I'm still very early on in this experience having not used iOS in about 10 years, but it's been interesting to say the least.",1,neutral,"Main object: iOS

what I like from android Pixel 3a and previosly a 5a 5G (that died with black screen) is the Work Profile, find it useeful to divide personal from work, sepecially the information. What I do not like from Pixels is the build quality, I thought the Pixel 5a metal body was going to be different, I ended up replacing a screen after a silly fall, then 6 months later the new ifixit screen died. I also have 2 pixels 3a, one with screen cracked and the other also received a seccond screen, one died from water and moisture. I'm surviving with a 3a until I find something like apple's phones that seem sturdier, any I feel the ability to implement a personal and work profile there could be possible but not as dynamic as in Android.

Cameras and photo quality, I think Pixels do more, but their photography has been manipulled with AI by the google camera since a while ago, the new Photos App showed with the new Pixel 8 does a lot of postproduction fixes as replacing faces, moving objects, deleting. What is a photo now?, I recently saw a photo taken with a iPhone 15 Pro Max and quality was good, you could zoom in to details to find faces imperfections as they are, on the other hand Google Camera seems to smooth faces, not really sure but I feel that.

I'm also debating if going for a smaller phone as the iPhone 13 mini, battery seems to be not that good, and so the system that as polished as it doen't feels as  dinamic as Android, it's incredible that iOS still doesn't have a close all open apps options and you have to swipe oup one by one to close them, and not just a button saying ""close all"" as Android does.

Similar thing when it came to phones. I just grew tired of the applications and the lack of care from OEM to make a sincere attempt in updating Android after two major updates.

2. Stage Manager for iPhone 15 Pro and Later.

4. New login options: Passwords would be the most secure way to log-in to your iPhone. I don't think that TouchID or Slide to Unlock will come back, but that's something I'd love to see return.

IOS,amirsadeghi,234944,"You don’t appreciate how good iPhone/iOS user experience is until you use an Android phone; My experience of using Android after using the iPhone for almost my entire adult life. || First, Excuse me for my bad English, it's not my first language 

I had to sell my iPhone X a bit early because I am waiting to buy the new iPhone. I’m aiming for iPhone 12 Pro. I don’t like huge phones and I think that 0.3 inch is a good upgrade.

TLDR at the end.

**Back to the topic**: I have been using iPhone since I’m 17. I have every iPhone since iPhone 4 and I never used or even touched an Android phone. Now, I had to buy a cheap android phone until I can order my new iPhone. This review won’t be about the device. It is solely about the user experience both OS provides.

1- **Complexity:** Man! Android is so hard to figure it out. I’m a software engineering student and I am really good at working with the software but it is impossible to find what you want the first time you use the phone. Example: I wanted to add a new fingerprint to my phone. You would think if you go to Setting-> Lock Screen -> Screen Lock Type and you click on Fingerprint, you can modify it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f0b386q6djs51.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=232620a22ab072eeffda81580d2093d1c03de225

But you were wrong, you can't modify your fingerprints in that part. you have to go to another section in your setting: Biometric and Security and then you can edit your fingerprints. This was my first interaction with. Everything is everywhere. You can't do what you want when you go to the setting. there are multiple settings for everything. 

2- **Attention to details**: This is the one I never realized how much is important to have. In my view, every single element in iOS is built with the mindset of user experience. I'm going to provide an example for this one too. When you want to create a new Alarm in iOS, you open the clock app and the first thing you see is that the time picker is showing the current time. However, on this version and build of the Android I have, it only shows you 6:00AM. No matter when you open the app and when you want to set your Alarm. I think by being able to count the hours you are going to sleep, you can have an understanding of your sleep quality.

3- **Third-party apps**: Third-party apps are horrible, design-wise. It seems developers only wanted to have a functional Android app instead of having a good Android app. Its obvious most apps and their developers are just doing the bare minimum to just make sure their app is working. Apps are full of bugs, bad design, and bad user experience. 

4-  **Focus Mode:** This is the one that impressed me on Android. I think google finds the right way to implement a way to help you have work or ""me"" time. You can start focus mode without providing any time frame. you can specify which apps you can access during the focus mode. once you turn it on, you will see a huge timer on your phone. After you hit your end focus time button, you will be prompted by a box that shows all the notifications you received during your focus time. I find it way better than do not disturb and screen time combined on iPhone, where you are forced to set an end time, and it is really hard to turn on-screen time manually. 

I understand this wasn't the pure android you would get by using Pixel phones, this is a Samsung phone with the Samsung Layout/Theme, but this is what people who use Android get. 

**Conclusion/TLDR**: I'm really impressed with the effort Apple put into its design/software process where you take everything for granted when you are using iOS. User Experience is awful in Android and iPhone is far more superior in that area. There are some exceptions to this like focus mode which I wish Apple can implement in the new version of ios.

Also, if you're working with software or creating your own, you might already have certain expectations on where to find stuff and measure the quality of the UI against your own expectations, but there might be more than one consistent ways of creating a good UI and UX. 

For example, what you describe on where to change a fingerprint in Android sounds completely logical and consistent to me (note that I don't own an Android device, so I can only go from your description).

1 - While I somewhat agree that you should be able to find fingerprint stuff in lock screen, if you get lost or can't find the thing you're looking for, the bottom of the page guides you to things that you have been looking for: 

[https://i.imgur.com/7aVlBmr.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7aVlBmr.jpg)

Also, you couldnt find the Biometrics setting when it's literally the next option in settings? It even says it's where to find settings for fingerprints, face recognition, etc. right under the option.

2 - You don't see it when you're setting an alarm but you see when the alarm will be set when you actually activate the alarm:

[https://i.imgur.com/FwjWstO.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FwjWstO.jpg)

I assume it's because people care more about the time they wake up than the amount of sleep they'd get. I don't know if it's different on the iPad vs iPhone but this iPad doesn't show how much time you'll be able to sleep when setting an alarm.

And don't get me started with some backwards things Apple does to iOS in general especially with file management. You'd think you'll be able to do things with files like on a computer (eg drag and drop from computer to iPad) but nope, gotta go through iTunes or some other work around.

IOS,kevinvanmierlo,139,"I totally agree that the iOS user experience is very good and easy. Note I'm an Android user myself, but am an app developer, so I'm testing on many devices.

But I don't think it's fair for Android to be compared to Samsung. You already said in your post that you're not using a Pixel and I understand this is what most people get. But just because it's what most people get, doesn't mean it's good. I tested on many phones and honestly Samsung is one of the worst phones I've ever used. I owned a Samsung S4 myself and while they got a lot better since, it's still a very different user experience than a Pixel. 

A colleague of mine switched from iOS to Samsung and asked me all kinds of questions how to do this, how to do that (because she couldn't find it herself). I had tremendous difficulty to find those things while it's just a few taps away on my Pixel. Also some questions she had because she didn't like how some things worked couldn't be altered. So I told her that's Samsung, this works amazing on my Pixel. So that kind off shows how different the Samsung user experience is compared to a Pixel user experience.

While the user experience of iOS is still easier than Android, I'd urge you to try a Pixel before you make your verdict about the whole of Android. I'd say that the Pixel has the best user experience of the Android devices I've used. Also if somebody (Android user) asks me what kind of phone they should buy I always say Pixel and urge them not to get a Samsung. It's just so different.",2,negative,"Main object: Android

Then I got an iPhone 6s and was like, ""oh, this is how a smartphone should be."" Generally with Android custom firmware, I was trying to chase the paradigm of ""stock Android,"" which back then you really couldn't get in the US. Now that Pixel is a thing and Pixel was Verizon exclusive at first, that seems silly, but, that's how it was back then. So I'd wipe the phone and install custom firmware on it that was much closer to stock Android to get rid of the bloat and other dodgy shit. Eventually I said ""iPhone or stock Android from this point forward,"" and the latter not being available, I stuck to my guns and bought an iPhone — and then, for the first time ever this year, I bought a second phone from the manufacturer of the one I currently had. Previously, I had replaced every phone I'd ever owned with one from a different manufacturer.

It's also just a bit jarring, not actually worse just different. For example, I use both. I *detest* Apple's reluctance to allow me to run an outbound firewall on iOS. I use NetGuard on Android, no analogous feature on iOS.

Additionally, Android let's me tell am app what access it has, not hoping a developer will let me limit what photos/videos they can see. All will be lazy and pick the all photos option from the API not ""write only"". Android would let me break that setting and run ""write only"" if they had that limit. (Yes a weak point but still) You can do ""selected"" then only select photos from the app itself, BUT Apple constantly nags ""OMG this app can't see all your photos are you sure you want that?""

Not saying Android doesn't have it's weaknesses, I'm just saying it's jarring either way. I would say a Pixel, or even installing the Pixel launcher on the phone would help.

There's a fine balance between flexibility and scalability, and I find that iOS offers the best balance of both.  It is consistently able to reduce my confusion, prioritization, and organization requirements, and with that reduction, I get more time to do things I need to get done.

As a previous android user, I still dislike that there is no consistent way to go back.

I also still don’t like the cold Design. Android started to become colorful with android 6 when I left and it was kind of shocking how colorless iOS is. You get used to it though. 

3rd party keyboards are buggy and swiftkey and the Google keyboard are terrible on iOS. Thankfully, the native keyboard has swipe and multi language support now so that isn’t a big issue anymore. 

All in all, I still won’t switch back anytime soon. The fact that I can pull out and take a call or make a photo with my 6s reliably is worth more than any customization.

The biggest issue so far has been the lack of a universal ""back"" behavior.

You might argue that such a case is the specific developer's fault, but I'd argue such a case shouldn't be possible at an OS level.

Certain nice to have features on Android that aren't on ios. Like a number row on the keyboard, charge time on the lock screen, and being able to put icons where you want on the home screen. App drawer is nice. There are workarounds to some of these things but it's not intuitive and you have to set up shortcuts or discover on a forum post.

Updates for the sake of updates. Watch OS was a frustrating experience when swiping home screens was removed. I went back to an old series 3 after that stopped working on my SE. They eventually brought it back. 

I originally switched to iOS because of more frequent updates but now I don't know if that's what I really want. All I know is, I'm definitely not buying a brand new phone anymore. I'm gonna go back to being behind the curve.

But hey, at least they still have one handed phones (13 mini). Maybe I'll continue to use both OS'",2,neutral,"Main object: IOS and Android

IOS,EverydayQuestions-,470,"Made the switch for my first time a year ago:

- Longevity. Loved my Samsung Note 9 but was very disappointed that after less than 2 years of ownership, it wasn’t to receive anymore major software updates. There’s no acceptable excuse for that. The user experience had also depreciated—for example, was noticing far more ads throughout OneUI and within native Samsung apps. Otherwise, I was generally unimpressed with the newest line of Android flagships (especially since ecosystem integration was important to me and Samsung was the only Apple-competitor in this regard).

- Ecosystem. My only Apple device thus far had been a 2017 iPad Pro which I love, but felt like I wasn’t getting the full experience without any other Apple devices. Meanwhile, the “Your Phone” app on Windows devices flat out never worked for me—very buggy at best, broken at worst. I ended up getting a MacBook at the same time I got the iPhone for a full ecosystem that *just worked* (was also in the market for an ultrabook-esque device). At the same time, had been disappointed with the Galaxy Watch Active 2–experienced all kinds of bugs with syncing to the phone, specifically in terms of calls/texts (and then Samsung abandoned the Tizen watch OS altogether). Also was considering trading up my iPad for an S7+ but read about so many issues with it—combined with my growing disappointment with Samsung—that I was steered away. Stayed with the iPad, and jumped to Apple entirely. 

- Simplicity. OneUI was so jammed-packed with features that it felt overwhelming while most of the customization options available in the Galaxy Store were very underwhelming. Meanwhile, Apple had come very far in recent years with offering viable alternatives to my must-have features on Android. Everything just worked, and worked together with all the other Apple devices seamlessly. As well, the accessory ecosystem is far larger—which adds a layer to scratching the customization itch—and I enjoy MagSafe way more than I’d expected. 

Apple isn’t perfect but I have no regrets, and the learning curve has been very manageable. My 12 Pro Max has held up great, haven’t found myself missing Android or running into any limitations. My experience has been fortified with the Apple Watch Series 6–the integration is seamless and the whole experience is higher quality. My M1 MacBook Pro admittedly has the steepest learning curve but it’s been a fantastic device for casual use, on-the-go work/hobbies, and again—top notch integration with my other devices.

I was unlucky enough to own a Huawei P30 Pro, a 850€ flagship. I got only 1 (!) Android update in 2,5 years (Android 9 to Android 10). Until November 2021, when I switched to iOS, I was still stuck on Android 10, although Android 12 was already out.

Also I hoped for better stability, a better ecosystem and more optimized 3rd part apps.Besides stability, which in my case is worse than in Android 10, I have not been disappointed.

Customization once was a big factor for me, but that was years ago. I found, most devices and their software worked best, when you don’t tinker to much with it (sad but true). So I don’t really miss it.

There are a few things that are a bit annoying on iOS (no YT Vanced, no option to choose default apps etc). But there is almost always a solution to my problems.

(Also local backups but can be done from Windows as well.) My last android device was a Galaxy S10. I doubt it’ll get security patches now like my current iPhone down the line. This is a big issue people often overlook. You shouldn’t have to wait for an update after investing on a flagship device. The companies should be obliged to provide that but hey, it’s android. Also the camera, I’m not a mobile photographer and I carry my Fuji camera with me everywhere for that purpose. But if I ever need to get a quick shot or video with my phone, I’ve never seen a more reliable device than an iPhone to get the job done.

Unlike Windows, however, where most PCs have the same user interface and run the same app, Android is very fragmented.

The ecosystem. I love first party apps and I hate to download 3rd party stuff to do basic things. My MacBook had everything preinstalled just like my iPhone.

* The camera. I always hear how the camera is the best camera ever in so many of the android phones I got, and I'm always disappointed. I have been really happy with the 13PM's camera so far. It isn't perfect, but it's one of the first times I've had one live up to the hype.
* The battery. The hype about the 13PM is legit. I get 2 full days of active use on a charge. I don't ever feel like I have to plug it in, or be careful about what I'm running. I just use it all day doing whatever on it and it's good. The vertical integration and hardware is crazy optimized.
* The continued support. I have had a few android phones and the last couple, while they could easily handle newer operating systems, will never get *official* updates. My last phone was an LG... they don't even exist in the phone space anymore so that's fun. It seems like the hardware keeps getting pushed where you won't be able to run half the stuff I want to run without upgrades, meanwhile my friends have iPhones from years ago on the recent OS running everything fine and getting current OS and security updates. 
* Apple Watch. I wanted to get an apple watch with some of the health monitoring systems it has built in, and without an iPhone they're basically a paperweight. 
* My wife got on the iOS platform a couple years ago, and I ended up getting an iPad and decided when I upgraded, I would just switch ecosystems. There's definitely things about android that I miss, but these days, most stuff is on both platforms. 
* The Apple SaaS and streaming ecosystem. Since my wife is in the Apple ecosystem. Meaning basically we could have a bunch of streaming services and such, so just get something like AppleOne and share it through family sharing. So we have a shared plan that gives us storage, music streaming, etc. for one fairly cheap price that works on all our devices easily.
* iMessage obviously! jk. I never use it. I still don't get the hype. I prefer Telegram experience and it's cross platform and the use experience is about 95% mirrored, it's way nicer.

There is definitely stuff I miss about android, I knew I would when I switched. There's stuff that annoys the fuck out of me on both systems.

IOS,Unknown,0,"The main thing? Updates. I had three different flagship phones and getting Android updates past a year was a problem unless you went custom firmware. 

Similarly, “stock Android.” I switched just before the Pixel came out. Today’s Android users don’t know how good they have it. Samsung is good and you can get stock Android on Verizon - that wasn’t possible back in the day. Back then you had to settle for some ad ridden fork like HTC Sense. Swipe too far in one direction and you get ads. Yup. And some said that - the HTC One M8 - was peak Android. 

If I had known Pixel was coming, who knows, but I’m glad I learned what peak Android was because it pushed me to iPhone. 

Although really - for those who were around and into phones then, could you blame me? Here were my choices:

-	HTC 10
-	Motorola Droid Turbo 2
-	Samsung Galaxy S7 (and Edge model)
-	LG G5
-	Apple iPhone 6s (and Plus model)

So yeah, most Android fans would admit, the iPhone easily wins. There was also the option of the Nexus 6P (and 6) but I would have had to pay for those all at once. So not really an option.

The HTC 10 was a popular phone, but it had a fatal flaw. A friend of mine literally went through more than half a dozen of them. Verizon couldn’t find him one that wouldn’t screw up after a week of Google Maps and Pokémon Go. There’s a reason you really don’t see HTC anymore. They never lived up to all the hype. Nice looking phones that ran like shit. My wife chose the Motorola - it was shit. 

So I guess you could say a third reason was a lack of good choices. To be fair though, Samsung good with the S8. All their flagships onwards have been solid choices, though I can’t explain the new one having no headphone jack or memory card slot.",1,negative,"Main object: Android

IOS,Kimantha_Allerdings,45643,"Security is the big one for me.

Firstly, I do all my banking, investment, etc. on my phone. A year or two ago I read an interview with a top-level Samsung executive who said that he wouldn't do his banking on his Samsung because it's not secure enough.

Secondly, if my phone is stolen I can not only find it from my computer, my iPad, or even my watch, but I can brick it, too. I can make it completely useless. And, because I've got Apple Care, I'll get a replacement for free.

Thirdly, they're secure in themselves. I remember a news story about someone in Trump's circle (IIRC it was Roger Stone, but don't quote me on that) having his iphone confiscated by the FBI. Apple wouldn't cooperate in granting them access, and it took their tech guys 3 weeks to get in. If it takes the FBI 3 weeks to get in, then I think it's unlikely that a random mugger is going to do better. Especially as, as per point 2, I can brick it remotely anyway.

Fourthly, less than 1% of all malware written for phones is made for ios.

I actually want to be able to have more stuff on the phone rather than physically on me (like my driver's license, for example). If my phone gets stolen I can prevent people from getting access to the data and it's easy to replace. If my driver's licence gets stolen, then someone's got my ID with the only security measure being that it's got a bad, washed-out photo of me printed on it. I know Apple's making small moves in that direction, and I hope it becomes a reality in the UK soon.

None of which is to say that I think the iphone is 100% secure. Or that all Androids are insecure. I'm also aware that Androids have been working on their security and it's now closer than it previously was. But I still think that iphones are the most secure devices currently on the market. To the point where if I'm signing up for something online on my PC and I have to pay for something I'll get the url and copy it to my iphone or ipad and use my credit card there. Because, much as I love my PC, try to be careful, and have protections in place, I think it's more likely that there's malware on my PC which will make entering sensitive information a bad idea.",1,positive,"Main object: iPhone (iOS)

That said, I’m curious to know about peoples experience and enjoyment with iOS 17 because from my perspective, I definitely think that this update caters to people who are deeply enveloped in the Apple ecosystem (like myself). This was an update to that more than it was to the iPhone itself. You’ll see even greater synchronicity with all of your devices as opposed to seeing improvement on just one. iOS 17 is an update for experience more than it is utility.

- Keyboard improvements have been amazing. Still not on-par with Android but it’s getting there.

Battery Life: Surprisingly, the battery life seems unchanged so far. I'm yet to notice any significant decrease. It's worth noting that my iPhone is still at 100% capacity after 7 months of use.

Performance: Given that this is the initial release, some occasional hiccups are expected. There are occasional animation stutters, but they're infrequent, much like what I experienced with iOS 16. Everything else remains snappy and responsive. It could be because my phone is just one generation behind, and the performance jump with the 15 Pro processor isn't substantial. After installation, expect some initial slowdowns and animation lag due to background indexing. The real experience starts to shine after at least 24 hours.

Keyboard: The keyboard is fantastic, with no stutters or delays.

I won't rant about it here as well, but other than that, which is a big 'that', I like the new iOS and subtle but meaningful changes. I also think namedrop will be huge in a few years.

* restricted permissions on iOS means higher privacy
* ""nagware"" (apps that are built to nag you) on lot of budget android phones

Android has the ability for apps to read SMS and IMEI numbers. Many finance apps refuse to run unless you give them these permissions. iOS does not allow apps to read either SMS or IMEI number. This is the reason I switched to iOS.

Second reason is that almost every phone manufacturer will add their ""nagware"" that are designed to annoy you until you give up your data. Even flagship phones will ruin your experience if you ignore their ""cable clubs"" or ""s-apps"". Pixel is not available in my country, so there are very few android devices I can comfortably use.

After using iOS for a while, there are apps that I use which are just not available on Android. So I will continue using iOS. There are still apps that I miss from Android. I believe the apps that become part of our lives are more important than details of the OS.

I don't believe there is much core differences for most people. iOS animation logic makes it appear speedier than android without actually being any fast. My iPhone 11 has now become very slow.

\- Doesn't slow down over time. On Android, the more apps you install, the slower it gets. For example, apps taken a bit longer to open up, or the scrolling will randomly jank

\- Multitasking is better for me. Theres no apps ""running"" in the background making my phone hot and using my battery

\- GPS and bluetooth actually work, rather than stop working after 3 months, or saying I'm in the ocean near Iceland

\- I use macbooks, so good integration there, regarding file transfer, clipboard etc

With that said, Android Kitkat was king, my favourite OS ever. Very slim, light, and looked good. If they 'bought that back', I would consider switching. Since Lollipop, the circular UI looks HORRIBLE, and they've chucked so much junk into their phones (like 'ok google') that I hate it.

IOS,Critical-Personality,1401,"I have always had both iPhone and Android till 6 months back. My partner still has both and we use Android one as more like a common phone between us.

There are many reasons but if I have to sum it up: It's more peaceful.

1. **Trust**: If my iPhone is with someone else (anyone for any reason), they can access only and exactly what I want them to access (guided access). There is no way they can do things that I don't want them to do.
2. **Apple is watching out for you**: I can download that weird looking game and never worry about viruses or the fear that the game actually does something other than what it says it does with my data (Apple would have removed the app from App Store if it did).
3. **Speed, Longevity and Support**: My iPhone 6s ran for 5 years+ before its battery went too bad and screen stopped working. Till then I got all the OS updates and the phone kept running like it was new (except some minor performance hiccups after major OS upgrades in last 2 years but that always sorted out in the next update or so).
4. **Simplicity of use**: My mom has an iPhone and an Android. If she faces a problem, I can tell her exactly where to look for what. Her auto update settings ensure that she is always at latest, so I don't have to ask the OS version either. Settings and menus keep changing from one Android to another by OS version, updates, manufacturer and each one calls some feature with another name. In addition, there is usually just one way to do a thing. Like I can't uninstall an app from settings menu somewhere so it's easier to help others.
5. **No Google (privacy)**: This is a personal belief, sort of. Android means Google. An android phone by default would be keeping a more keen eye on my behavior so that the parent company (Google) could extract more profits out of me in some way or the other. Apple does not have any business poking around my data for more than diagnostics and some behavioral ones. And on that point, no matter which country you are in and from, the government will always have your data one way or the other. There is a good possibility Apple might also be sharing some of it with the US government but I just hate the way Google keeps watching all the time.

In addition I have other Apple hardware so the ""ecosystem"" perks come up. Like I can keep my AirPods in my ears and switch from a call on mobile to a movie on Apple TV to a call on Laptop to my iPad for a bedtime video without having to take them off, or connect/disconnect any of those manually. Life is just easy with them.

Above all, it feels like **iPhone is MY Phone**. You can do whatever you want to do with it but it will only open up if it is sure that you are the owner of it. And recently I found that if I remote-wipe the phone using iCloud, it won't let me use it with another Apple ID until I enter the password for the older account - that happens on the setup screen so there is no way to bypass it. You can disassemble it, break it into parts but it will not work for you or give you my secrets. It truly *feels like* it belongs to you and is loyal.

From Facebook apps that you can't uninstall, to carriers having all sorts of apps tracking stuff, to Samsung having their own duplicates of almost every Google app, it's unacceptable. Yes I *could* root the phone and install a clean OS (unless the boot loader has been locked), but why in the world should that even be necessary?

The iOS App Store has very few ""dodgy"" apps that could be classed as malware. But the Google Play store has frequent reports of apps that steal your data. ""Oh you should be more careful what you download, it's up to the user to verify the apps"". NO. My phone is not a Windows PC, I use an iPhone precisely because I DO NOT WANT to be a sysadmin or a security researcher.

I would say updates might be te biggest win, but they do slow the devices down, also, lately, Samsung is promising 4 years of OS updates to many devices.

Also, iOS is so locked down, to the point of not really being able to do any real work on it. Accessing files from different apps, transferring files, importing and editing... It's a nightmare. Truly crappy decisions and artificial limitations made in the name of safety.

I love my iPhone and iPad, but I basically use the iPhone as a secondary device, and the iPad for reading comics and looking up ingredients and recepies while I cook. And some very light apple arcade gaming ( I absolutely loved What The Golf)

Android has matured quite a lot, and a lot of people are harbouring some prejudices from 10 years ago when Android had been... Rough around the edges.

Also, many people are comparing low end/ midrange devices with iPhones, which kinda misses the point. Also $300-400 Android device gives you a real powerhouse today.

And different Android devices work really well together.

Also, sharing/accessing/editing/transferring files on Android works wonderfully. As amateur photographer, bringing my android tablet or just a phone works wonders with transferring, editing and exporting photos. On iPad you have to jump through so many hoops, is maddening.

The first thing is just a no brainer. NO WHERE can you get service like you can at the Apple store. My iPhone 6 had a semi faulty TouchID sensor. The accuracy was more 75% instead of the 98% I'd see on my 5S. Walked into the store, guy asked what was wrong, he asked if I had reset it which I said yes, and he walked into the back and walked out with a refurbished unit that was Mint. Let me sync both devices and I was on my way without paying a dime (no credit card holds, shipping or fees)

NO android manufacturer makes it this easy and dealing with carriers is a nightmare. Most often then not you get a refurbished model that isnt as nice as what you are giving up. I've received refurbs from both Verizon and T-Mobile and they have has scratches, marks, and one even had screen scratches on it.

The other thing is jail breaking. Now I'm gonna get hate for this but Jailbreak &gt; Root IMO. Now Xposed closed this gap, but since it is DOA with Lollipop I can't consider it anymore. Whereas with Android you have you flash a ROM to get what mods you want, and then reflash manually (for most without OTA support) to get newer mods, on iOS all your mods install above the normal ""ROM"" which makes modifying the device stupidly simple and allows you to pit exactly what you want on, when you want it.

* Consistency

The whole ecosystem follows one design language, and always must follow it. Meanwhile, on Android, you can have an app designed for Lollipop on Gingerbread, and an app designed for Gingerbread on Lollipop. Too much ""variety"".

* iMessage

I hate being that one guy that uses an Android phone, while almost all my friends use iOS devices and therefore message with iMessage. I only know ONE PERSON who uses Hangouts. Intergration is key.

* Touch ID

Who doesn't want a fingerprint sensor for unlocking your phone and making purchases?

* App Store

More quality apps because of the smaller device selection. Filtered apps means all apps look nearly the same (consistency and reliability). Better design and layout compared to the Play Store.

* Update Rollouts

Even if OEMS are doing better with new OS releases, Apple supports devices much longer, and gives updates to all fo them almost immediately. My barely outdated iPhone 5-esque Galaxy S3 LTE had a hard time getting KitKat on TouchWiz from Samsung. I won't even expect a Lollipop update anytime soon. Meanwhile, the iPhone 4S got iOS 8 (even if it is super slow.)

* Closed-off ecosystem.

There is a few Apple devices, all running fairly similar hardware, all made by one manufacturer. Meanwhile, there is tons of Android devices, all running different hardware from another, and made by many many MANY different manufacturers. People complain about how iOS is so closed off, but in order to achieve what they have, they need the closed off garden. I couldn't imagine how much better Android would be if it were just Nexus devices that got released and it was closed off for every other manufacturer.

* Development Tools

Oh, come on. So much better on iOS. Smaller device selection so it's easy to develop and know what your app will look like on all platforms. It's easy to follow design guidelines and easy to find stuff while on Android it's all jumbled around and you are forced to have to support many different devices with different aspect ratios, different hardware, different resolutions, and add to that a million different devices to support.

From Android, we're kind of at a ""grass is always greener"" standpoint. Most of us here use Android way more than we use iOS, so we notice the inconsistencies of our platform a lot more. We look at iOS and ooh and ahh at how every app looks the same, and everyone follows the guidelines.

However, I have read a fair amount of complaints from iOS users as well about the inconsistencies of their platform as well. The back button isn't always in the same place. There is apparently no guideline for the slide out menu, so almost every app is different. Some only slightly, and some are like a puzzle to figure out.

Not really, at least not anymore.  

I was using a Pixel 5 recently and now an iPhone 13 mini.  

The gesture-based navigation is basically the same on both, so it was an easy transition.

I'd say Android actually wins on a few minor usability and simplicity items (ex. laying out the home screen, notifications being much simpler but with more granular control, the consistent ""back"" gesture that's missing on iOS but most app still support it).

I've heard people say that iOS apps are simpler or follow a more consistent design compared to their Android counterparts, but I've found the same apps on both Android and iOS are pretty much identical.  And I use a bunch of different apps.

Besides that, iOS mostly on par.  Nothing iOS does is better than google's pixel (stock) android except perhaps face id.  But I like the 13 mini size so it has become my primary device.",4,neutral,"Main object: Android

IOS,Unknown,0,"I used to float between Android and iOS but these days I firmly prefer iOS. I bought a Z Flip4 last month and it made me realise how much much I prefer iOS now, but in the past I was happy to switch every 6m/year.

I prefer iOS because:

\- Consistent and well designed UI. I love the animations and the overall UI language. I don't like really like Google's design or any of the OEM UIs. Huawei's EMUI was nice when I had a Huawei P30 Pro but I'm yet to find another that I like.

\- Features like Handoff and Continuity (phone calls between my iPhone/iPad/Mac/HomePod/Apple Watch, copy/paste between my iPhone/iPad/Mac, being able to use my Mac keyboard/mouse on my iPad, being able to turn my iPad into an external display for my Mac)

\- Quick updates released to everybody at once. Pixel phones are pretty much the only Android device to get timely updates, but after briefly having a Pixel 6 Pro just after launch? Not trying that again any time soon. iPhones also get updates for years longer than any Android phone has so far.

\- Face ID, I like picking my phone up and holding it however I want and looking at it instead of holding it so the right fingers are on the fingerprint reader and lining my finger up just right to unlock.

\- Visual Voicemail (this one is solely because my mobile network only supports it on iOS, I'm fully aware Android phones support it)

\- Accessories. iPhones have the widest range of cases and always have, and now with MagSafe it's fun having lots of attachables too.

\- AirPods. I've used everything from Sony to Bang & Olufsen to Bose to Samsung to Huawei and I can't find anything that has the same experience as AirPods with automatic device switching and system integration for battery life and Find My etc and is as comfortable in the process.

\- AirDrop for sending files between friends or between my devices

\- Niche little thing, but password manager integration works better on iOS. On Android if you use the Oreo/newer above the keyboard option then you won't get auto-copied TOTP codes from Bitwarden and 70% of the time it wouldn't pop up at all. The old overlay option works as consistently as iOS, but it doesn't look as nice and giving apps permissions to see what's on screen 24/7 isn't great security (although it would be fair to argue that if the app has all my passwords, it's fine).

However, there are things I prefer about Android:

\- New fun hardware features. My favourite phone ever was the OnePlus 7 Pro, that screen to body ratio was gorgeous and the pop-out camera to avoid a notch or hole punch was incredibly fun, the folding phones are exciting too.

\- Spam call blocking. Google's default Phone app does a way way way better job at identifying and blocking spam calls than any third party iOS call filtering app does, and iOS itself does nothing.",3,positive,"Main object: iOS

Apps are designed with iOS in mind, so they generally work and look better. This has a lot to do with limited Apple Hardware choices unlike android. With Android, there are so many hardware devices that are out there and app writers have to accommodate as many as they can. 

Someone pointed on resale value. 

Apple supports there devices for at least a few years and you get updates right away. Funny how sometimes people complain about it but if one things about it, that's a good thing!

While Android offers more personalization, it's almost too much. I feel overwhelmed, and at least the last time I tried it, it was too difficult to find apps that were spammy, or stopped developing after a year or so. iOS works with all my other Apple devices, and I'm firmly in the ecosystem. If there are bugs, there's an update pretty quickly to fix it, and AppleCare is unmatched for replacements and repairs. Even though app purchases tend to be more expensive, I also find that development on apps tends to have greater longevity, with some apps I've been using for a decade. Do I wish I could change the font on my phone? No, not really. Do I want to be able to move icons around so that they're not always stuck from the top down? Yes. Is it worth it to completely throw off my workflow and re-adjust to updates that completely change my phone's behavior (or happen so infrequently or stop because a device is suddenly no longer supported even when I'm still paying it off)? Nope. I'm becoming an old person and don't like it when I have to completely relearn how a device works. 

My spouse is firmly tethered to Android, but the recent updates to his device have made him frustrated, and every time he hands it to me to try to find or fix something, I can't even figure out how to use it.

While I do sometimes miss the full customization that Android offers, I got used to iOS and what it offers, and really like how smooth it all is. Plus, its ecosystem is unlike any other. I gave all of my Samsung stuff to my SO and fully dived into the Apple ecosystem due to how smooth and, franky, superior it is. Not to mention the speed. I'm using iPhone 13 Pro and I haven't had a single issue with it so far, and I use it fairly heavy on a daily basis. I travel a lot lately and I use it to record my trips. Everyone I know is always saying how good the videos are and the picture quality is really amazing. It also packs a lot of horsepower. I can basically play AAA games on it (the few that are available) for hours without any loss in performance.  Recently I've been playing Wreckfest and it works amazingly well all maxed out. My old Samsung would struggle like crazy with it.  


  
As for the walled garden, I don't have any real issues with it. I use the software that is provided to me on the App store, plus Google services are almost fully open to iOS users. I still use Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Translate and other Google branded apps and services. It's really not as closed as you may think.

IOS,ChuckF93,978,"I don't necessarily prefer iOS as I'm a new iPhone user since about last month. It used to be that iPhones had very little customization compared to Android, but that's not necessarily the case these days. I really like the lockscreen widgets(iOS 16) and the widget stacks you can have, something the latter of which I've only ever seen on Samsung. I also stopped using 3rd party launchers on Android because they don't play well with gesture navigation.

There are a few things that make me really enjoy the iPhone experience:

CarPlay over wireless works so much better for me compared to Android Auto. This will really depend on your stereo, though. CarPlay wireless just connects and starts so much faster for me and runs so much smoother on my hardware. In newer factory cars where the stereos typically go through far more validation, I've found this to not be an issue and wireless AA connected plenty fast for me. But I have an older car with an aftermarket stereo(granted a high end one) with CarPlay and Android Auto, and my experience with CarPlay has been very positive overall(minus certain messaging apps not being supported...grrr).

The availability of smaller devices. I use a 12 Pro which is about 146mm tall. That's 14mm shorter than my OnePlus 8T that I was using before. In one-handed use that makes all the difference in the world. It's just the right size and combined with decent battery life(a combo that basically only exists on a very small number of Android phones), it was a great fit for me. The vast majority of Android phones have just become giant in order to fit massive batteries to cope with the middling power efficiency of the modern SoCs they've been using the last couple years.

FaceID is superb. It works so reliably and makes using and unlocking my phone such a breeze in all conditions including wearing sunglasses outside(haven't tried it with a mask yet since my area and school eased the mask requirements prior to me getting the iPhone).

I wouldn't be too worried about the walled garden unless buying an iPhone convinces you to also buy a Mac or iPad or Apple Watch as well. Then I can imagine you might have a hard time leaving the ecosystem. Me personally, I use my laptop for work and there's software I use that simply isn't supported on Mac. I have a custom built beast of a gaming PC at home that I'm very happy with. I have a Samsung tablet that works very well for me.

I used to be hardcore with rooting, installing custom roms, customising etc with android but now I don’t really have the time or the patience to do those. 

I will simply compare the things I like and hate on both platforms
1.	Hate being ecosystem locked with iOS unlike android (well android mobile companies started to ecosystem lock lately anyways)
2.	Hate iOS calculator
3.	iOS keyboard and dictionary is absolute garbage compared to Google’s. And Gboard for iOS is useless as well since it’s simply using the same layout as iOS keyboard. I want the number pad on the top and long press to give multiple options.
4.	this might just be me but we can’t view call history in iOS after a certain period of time (I think about a month?) and google dialer is simply better in terms of spam call blocking.
5.	I really love iOS ram management. It’s just good.
6.	iOS is really smooth and seamless in general. Android still way behind in terms of smoothness (seems like ios 16 has been a little buggy since release. There was a time my iPhone went from 90s% to 20s% over night but it’s fixed now with latest patch)
7.	not a big fan of Siri but it’s not bad either. it does the job. I like google assistant more.
8.	I could sideload apps in android which I can’t do in iOS. Really annoying for me
9.	hate how greedy Apple is
10.   Apple is killing it in battery department lately. There’s simply no competition.
11.    I’m so spoiled with type c everywhere and now my iPhone is the only odd one out. (Ik they’re going for type c next year and probably portless in the coming years) And it’s freaking slow. By slow I mean slowwwwwwwww. I usually record gameplays and export it to laptop to edit. But nah I gave up. 
12.   iPhone camera tends to give warmer image output for some reason. Maybe it’s just my 2 year old mobile. But hey I’m not much of a mobile shooter so it’s not a big deal for me.

If you don’t mind being ecosystem locked and throwing some extra bucks then iOS would be an extremely good upgrade for you.

IOS,Reviews_DanielMar,813,"I thought about this earlier today. 

Everyone talked about the ecosystem (airdrop, iMessage, iCloud, etc..), but based on videos I’ve seen, Samsung seems to have really caught up on that. Maybe not the the same extent, but I can’t say 100% as I have no personal experience with Samsung. 

Here’s my story. 5 years ago, I switched from an iPhone 6s to a Huawei P10. At first, I LOVED it. I was trying something new. My initial impressions were, the software was snappy and fast, it has an endless amount of features, the hardware was just better. After using it for a while, it became a headache and frustration to use. It wasn’t precise like my iPhone and iOS. The best way to describe it was, Android on the Huawei P10 felt WAAAYY more stuttery than iOS on my iPhone 6s. Try to get from one app to another quickly? It would freeze for a sec on Android, making it a buggy experience, but seamlessly execute on iOS. Scrolling through the home page, my Huawei would confuse my scrolling with tapping on an app and open it, while iOS is less sensitive with that. This can be translated to the keyboard as well. Over a year later, I switched back to iPhone.

I’m not saying iOS is perfect and Android sucks. iOS has buggy issues can are arguably comparable or worst than Android (especially with iOS 11, things like iOS hesitating to rotate to the correct orientation). However, one thing is true about iOS that Apple has always said, “It just works”. Does this mean it will do anything you want it to do? No. It means it simply does what you need it to do, and developed and designed that way. That means it’s user interface is generally designed for those are aren’t quite tech savvy (although whatever platform is “easier” is subjective to what one is use to), but generally, iOS is cleaner with less “things” on the UI. Also, given that iOS is designed with its hardware in mind and generally vice versa (they’re designed by the same company), everything it going to be more seamless (the software is going to be more responsive and not feel like an afterthought). I think it’s always going to be this way, where iOS is for those who just want to use the software, while Android is for those who want to play with the software. 

Now, my experience with Android is limited to that, so feel free to challenge this.",1,neutral,"Main object: iOS

IOS,chromastic,292,"1. Spotlight. Swiping down on any homescreen opens Search. Type two or three letters of the app you want and hit ""go."" There are ways to emulate this on Android, but none work as well.
2. Home Controls in Control Center. I can control home devices without unlocking my phone and it requires just 2 interactions with the phone (swipe down and tap). On any Android device that is not a pixel, unlocking is required and it requires at least 3 interactions to control a home device.
3. Live Photos. It just adds a lot of value to photographic memories. Android should copy it.
4. FaceID. It took me a long time to come around on this, but it's gotten faster and faster with each generation since iPhone X and now unlocking an Android phone with a fingerprint sensor feels like it has a greater mental burden.
5. MagSafe. I have a MagSafe PopSocket on an iPhone 14 Pro Max. Without it, the phone would 100% be too large to use. I pop it off when I get in my car and place it on a MagSafe phone mount. I also have a MagSafe battery. Again, Android should just copy it. It took a while, but the ecosystem is really starting to take off.
6. Always-on Display. I know this one is controversial, but what I really like is how consistently it works. One tap and it immediately fades in. On Android phones, sometimes it takes one tap, sometimes it takes two, and the animation timing is inconsistent.
7. AirDrop. I'm aware that Android has Nearby Share, but it's not on every Android phone and I doubt as many people know how to use it.
8. FindMy. Downside is that it locks you into Apple products, but it's essentially a huge mesh network, so I trust that any device with FindMy integration will likely be pinged by nearby Apple devices.
9. Wallet. I can add plane, movie, and concert tickets to Wallet. Android has a Wallet equivalent, but few apps support adding passes to it.
10. Mobile Device Management. iOS does a really good job of sandboxing work related apps and data so my workplace lets me access work email on the stock Mail app and view calendar events on the stock Calendar app. Technically I can access work content on an Android phone, but because the sandboxing is not as robust, I'm stuck using Boxer and there's no way to integrate email and calendars into stock apps and view them overlaid with personal content.",1,positive,"Main object: iOS

The ability to swipe from left or right side of the screen to go back in any app at any time. I miss this feature sooooooo much and I do it on iPhone every day (of course it doesn't work).

The floating window which I use with google translate. There is no good implementation of translations on ios devices. I communicate in multiple languages (often through whatsapp). On android I copy text of a message, then I click the google translate icon thats always shown on the screen somewhere and it automatically translates the text. On iPhone, I have to copy text, leave the screen and go to the app to paste and translate. cumbersome!

I like the ability to have a quick and easy copy/paste button on android. On iPhone, sometimes its hard to copy/paste. Its only available in the pop-up menu that shows when it feels like. sometimes I want to paste in betweeen word and I have to put the cursor there hoping the paste menu shows up or select a word and hope the copy menu shows up. On Android, this copy/paste menu can be found right above the keyboard. 100% of the time the keyboard is active. its much easier to use in this case.

My biggest ups:

- Phone is still as fast and as smooth as day 1, even with a ton of apps installed.  Android seemed to always have issues with this.

- Password manager integration.  This is the ""killer app"" for iOS for me.  Android simply doesn't come close on this.

- Auto-fill and OTP password integration, especially on OTP over text message.  No more switch to Android Messages, copy/remember the code, switch back to app, paste.


My biggest downs:

- Keyboard and more specifically swipe text entry.  Auto-correct jokes are numerous for a reason and swipe text entry is wrong more than it's right.

- Home screen layout is laughably bad.  Please just leave things where I left them, iOS.  We don't all think in left-to-right, top-to-bottom organization.

- Persistent apps.  I use Home Assistant and presence detection using the app is terrible because iOS stops the updates all the time.  Same with photo backups to Google Photos or anywhere else.",3,positive,"Main object: iPhone Mini 12 and iOS

What I missed about Android I could do with my jailbroken iPhone and it is leagues or even light years ahead of Android customization. 

On stock iOS the few things I really miss are Android notifications but having said that I’ve gotten use to iOS ones. 

Proper icon packs. For how amazing iOS is god is it super fricking ugly to me. Like don’t get me wrong shortcuts is an amazing app but I wish I could apply theme automatically like Android or snowboard in iOS. 

Another thing is importing music on my device. I tend to listen to a lot of leaked or live recordings of artists (especially SOPHIE) and due to that it was so much easier to download and import those songs on Android. I did find a way to do it jailbroken but now than I’m on stock iOS it hurts. 

My last one is the Lock Screen. I love it but the clock is so meh. There’s tons of space and yet the clock takes up a small portion of it and idk why.

IOS,gagdude,305,"I switched to an iPhone last year after using Android since 2012 and never looked back. That being said, the stability/bug-freeness of iOS is vastly overrated imo. I run into a plethora (but non deal breaking) bugs, which is a similar experience to Android. Even on first party apps like Messages and Screen Time.

The ecosystem is pretty locked down and causes various inconveniences related to the usage of Apple applications - e.g. clicking an address from Messages prompts to open Apple Maps only, forcing me to copy the address and paste into Google Maps. 

The keyboard is terrible compared to Gboard on Android (especially the autocorrect which is HORRENDOUS), and using a third party keyboard on iOS introduces inconsistencies like typing in a password field reverting to the built in keyboard.

The notification shade is archaic compared to Android as well, require double swipes to dismiss, really awkward grouping, no consistent way to dismiss all, no expanding for more info, etc.

However, the quality of applications, especially third party, in general is much much superior - which at the end of the day is the purpose of a smartphone. And perhaps the biggest thing is iMessage and FaceTime, as much as I hate that it is the case. It’s integrated well with MacOS, allows for robust and fast conversation with anyone with an iPhone, and yeah, blue bubbles…

No fingerprint so unlocking it with a passcode cause face id sucks (even with a watch, it’s terribly inconsistent) and even when it works, gotta slide up precisely from the bottom. Missing important notifications because holy god who designed this. I could go on and on. 

Example: swiping right from anywhere on the screen in the Reddit app will take you back. It’s the only app that works like that, it’s a navigation nightmare. I honestly think most Apple fans have simply never used an android device. You guys, apple sucks so bad. Honestly hate this phone multiple times a day. Did I mention the keyboard tech from 1999? 

Additionally, I keep hearing about stability. I have no idea what you mean by that. There’s no shortage of folks with iOS issues. Ecosystem could have an argument made for it, except that on setup it recommends Google for search and browser cause Apple knows it sucks. Heads up, you’ll also need Google maps eventually. 
Meanwhile Android users need Apple products for exactly nothing. 

It’s a shame. I don’t care about customization, wanted to love the switch and fully expected to. Hardware (watch, airpods) have been years ahead and they’re sweet, but not worth the day-to-day garbage ui experience coupled with the added expense.

Edit: Siri, like trying to go back in iOS is worse than bad, because it’s inconsistent. You never know if back is gonna be an ’X’ on the top R, ‘done’ top left, or if right swipe will work cause am I at the beginning of the app -form? You never know if siri is going to recognize your request and context.

Initially it took me a while to get used to everything even though I had used iPhones in the past and I'm very tech savvy. I didn't know how to do many things. I was the type of person who always managed files and documents on my SD card, always rooted my phone, installed custom ROMs, overclocked processors and heavily customized my home screen. All in all I was an Android power user and used my phones to their full power. 

Switching to iOS and I realized that I'm not into that sort of stuff anymore because it's simply not there. Everything is nice and smooth. Hell I even didn't change my wallpaper since the past year. Sure I do miss having an Always on Display but that's about it. My XS Max is fast enough for most tasks and I'm gonna keep it jailbroken on iOS 14.8 as I don't like iOS 15. I don't miss constantly having to buy SD cards when running out of storage as the 256GB is plenty. Syncing, backing up stuff and restoring is just plain seamless with iCloud as well as iTunes. Though I do miss having a fingerprint scanner, FaceID is good enough that I don't think about it 90% of the time.

What I do miss from Android (or Google in general) is Gboard. Gboard on iOS is still very basic and hasn't been updated in a very long while. But I prefer using it over stock iOS keyboard mainly because it lacks haptic feedback when clicking on letters. I also miss some apps that were available on Android and not on iOS, however apps on iOS are way better and nicely built than their Android counterparts.

In Windows, I had to install multiple software to streamline my development processes, whereas Mac came equipped with dev tools. The build processes were faster (this was still an Intel machine). 

I was a die-hard Android user and had been since ~2010. Owned almost all galaxy series since S2. The frustrating thing was that I almost felt forced to buy a Galaxy series every year. After a specific time, it always started to feel like slowing down and not as snappier as it used to when first purchased. Anyway, after using a Macbook for several months, I decided to give iPhone a try. I bought 12 Pro and returned it because the screen size was too small ( I was switching from Galaxy S10+) and then purchased 12 Pro Max.

* iPhone Mini: a normally sized phone
* Not Google

This looks like I made the wrong choice. I'm still satisfied and OK with it. You have to get used to it. My biggest problem is: file handling. That's a real PITA.

Apple makes choices that are so uncomprehensible. When I bought the phone, I could not update it over data, only over wifi. With Android I've been updating over data since 2013, and I bet it was possible before that. What the reasoning here is - it's something I cannot understand. If you do this to protect people, make wifi the default, give a good warning, but let me decide in the end. Apple makes more of these decisions that are so limiting. Like the filebrowser.

The other main thing I really do dislike on iOS is how notifications are managed. I find myself unable to swipe to dismiss the notification half the time. On Android, if I didn't want to receive a particular notification, I would hold onto it, then untick the box and it would ensure that would never appear again. Nothing of the sort on iOS without having to manually go into the settings. When I try to swipe to dismiss when I'm watching a video, that doesn't seem to work half the time. It's a fairly clunky approach that doesn't seem to work. Widgets are fine. Just fine. I only have the one that date/ calendar. 
A key concession for me when I started to consider iOS was me not caring as much about customization. My Android phone was just had a simple time and date widget, plus a calendar widget. However with iOS, it really bothers me how plain everything still is. Not entirely sure why you customize the grid layout. At the very least make it denser? Icons still need to be auto-arranged? It's all too formulaic. 

Having said, I do genuinely appreciate how fluid everything is. The overall experience is just so fluid that it makes it a breeze to use. The camera is remarkable. I find myself taking more photos due to it and its honestly a joy to use. The UI on it is simple enough. I suppose I could have done this on my Android phone, but I now scan my documents and photos using my phone (13ProMax) so it allows me to have an electronic copy of everything. The apps seem polished and plentiful. I recently limited the ProMotion display, and despite using it for some time, I don't seem to miss it as the OS still seems very responsive and fluid. I did my research coming into iOS, but I primarily considered it as the battery life on the 13ProMax was being acclaimed. I knew the cameras would be great so the main issue was iOS. I've since got the 512gb variant and honestly, despite the iOS's obvious shortcomings for me, I do genuienly like this phone. I hope to get the battery replaced before the warranty ends on it, but I do see myelf having this phone for the foreseeable future.",1,neutral,"Main object: iOS

However, after seeing my boss interact with his phone / iPad / Mac seamlessly with apple services, it appealed to me - plus I have a MacBook so it kind of made sense.

Initially I bought a refurbished iPhone 13 (would recommend buying refurb!) to see how it would fare, after you've done an android transfer which is pretty easy, signing into your bits and bobs could potentially be a chore, but it's actually relatively simple, and quick. It's just a nice experience really... I don't care for the endless customisation or jailbreaking into other stores for android, but I DO care for integration cross platform, which the Apple Ecosystem does very well.

Shortly after, I've bought a watch and an iPad Pro, long story short (and, dear god I wish I wasn't using this line....) but it just works... stuff I didn't even use before like FaceID and ApplePay have integreated seamlessly into my day to day.

I save documents to my iCloud Drive, I can get it on anything.. I can sync safari across everything, hell, I can even make edits on Resolve with my iPad, then save the project to the cloud and carry on elsewhere!

IT'll take some getting used to, but it'll be fluent with you in a couple of weeks.

Although echoed by some others, the file management is there and it's alright, but it's by no means perfect - and things like Adobe want you signed in with your apple account to access their services - this took me a day and a half to figure out why I couldn't use Lightroom on my iPad, despite having a subscription.",3,positive,"Main object: Apple ecosystem (iOS)

That said:
-iPhones and Macs eventually become obsolete without system and app updates 

-Apple eventually discontinues new iOS / MacOS release for any device it deems obsolete. They’re known for blocking Siri feature even though iPhone 4 was capable of using Siri. 

-Apple blocks the ability to downgrade to a previous version iOS not to mention old devices will gradually perform slower as the result of updating to new OS versions. This is why I don’t update my devices and Apple is notorious for buggy updates.

* Changing the wallpaper, and activating flashlight and camera from lock screen is infuriating. Can’t be disabled. 
* All the good android apps are paid in iOs and usually not a one time payment, but a monthly or annual fee. WTF!!!!! 
* The keyboard works incorrectly. For some reason it constantly detects close keys being pressed, usually when writing something uncommon ie: a code or passphrase. Also it removes the last character of my texts when chatting, idk why. 
* Selecting text functionality also is not good compared to android. 
* Moving files from pc to iphone is a pain in the ass.
* The clock app doesn’t show you the the time you have left for sleeping when setting up an alarm.

IOS,Justy50,518,"Software-advantages over Android as a Power User? || Hey Reddit,

longtime Android User here, interested in iPhones and in iOS and all the cool software-features that comes with it! Especially just iPhone-related ones, without any kind of additional Ecosystem-Hardware. No Watch, no iPad – just the Phone.

Background: I‘m looking into a new phone and to be honest, i just want something fresh. I actually still really like android. Not because i install custom rom‘s on it or anything, but i like all the little things. The general freedom with things. I‘m heavily into google‘s software (both private and at my job) and it just works great. 

So, why the hell do i want to look into iPhones if i‘m happy with android? Well, its the hardware.

Iphones just look cool, have amazing build quality and stellar performance and battery life! And i really like the way how it takes video. 

Now, with android you have a lot of great products as well, but if you really want a high-end and premium experience all around, the old meme (samsung vs apple) still persists. Googles own Pixel‘s are better than before, but the 6 is still not really close to the high end S Series on Samsung. 

And with Samsung itself, well its not ideal right now. The Standard S22 has a pretty bad battery life, the S22+ looks better on paper but its still pretty much the same as last years s21+. Not a fan of the S22 Ultra. Currently i‘m rocking a S10 Lite (don‘t let the name fool you, in exynos regions it‘s actually the best S10 Version). And yeah, while we‘re at it: i really don‘t like how samsung uses two different SoC in different regions.

So, back to my initial question for people that use both platforms (equally! don‘t compare a $200 android to a $1000 iPhone): What are the cool things you can do as a power-user? I don‘t live in the US, so iMessage and all the other apple-only features are pretty much meaningless here. Facetime is cool, but i have no problem with google duo or whatsapp-video. 

In general, i know all about the obvious ones, like longer software-support, better use of the camera api in 3rd party apps etc.

Music production apps are miles ahead on iOS in terms of quality and functionality.
Automation features on Android are miles ahead thanks to Tasker.
Customisation on Android is obviously better.
The whole “it just works” thing is better on iOS.
IMHO the sharing menu is better on iOS but there’s still a gap between iOS and Android with competing standards for wireless sharing which means generally you’ll be falling back to a messaging app, email, or cloud storage if the other person is on a different OS.
Work profile stuff on Android makes more sense as an end user as you have a separate collection of apps and you can switch it off and in whenever you want. On iOS certainly for Microsoft apps you have the same apps and need to switch profiles individually.
Bluetooth connectivity seems to be a lot more stable than Android for me.
Camera and video quality is very subjective and nowadays between flagships it’s more about personal preference, but I find that in general operations iOS has a definite edge for video, especially when transitioning between lenses during a video.
I can still access all of my Google services easily with basically the same apps available to me.

As far as what iOS and its apps can do vs. Android, not really much. In fact, I'd say Android has more ""power-user"" function than iOS, at least in terms of what I'd use:

\- the big one, splitscreen. With iOS you're stuck on one app. Which, arguably is advantageous if you have trouble focusing but I miss being able to browse and watch something at the same time.

\- PiP (for free Youtube in particular)

\- Messages on PC (for iOS you need a Mac to answer texts in that fashion, can't answer iMessage on PC)

\- Google assistant just being on another tier compared to Siri

iOS is much smoother and fluid over android and has nice animations everywhere, where android doesn’t but you can speed up the animations on android for which seems like a faster experience. 

The touch seems more responsive on apple devices, like I can type much faster and the keyboard is more responsive. Scrolling is different.. android seems to have smooth scrolling where apple has a slower scroll but it’s still smooth, annoying at times when you want to scroll far down.

IOS,Suplink_,34,"Becoming a professional Mobile Developer : what are the requirements ? || Hello there !

I'm currently in my 4th year in IT school. I still got another year until i graduate. I have trouble finding what i want to do after, what will fit me the best. 

My big dilemma is whether going for Web development (it's where i have the most experience), or mobile dev (android or ios, i've only did an expo app once with expo).

I dit a lot of React which is a lot similar to React Native. It wasn't that hard to create a React native app coming from web programming.

The thing here is that i don't know if it still possible to be provisionally viable if i start focussing on learning mobile dev right now. i can do 1 year of mobile development internship btw.

Working on iOS and android.
My experience is mobile development is a difficult field to make it in. It is certainly more niche than web development , however, it is easier to get a job as a mobile developer. 
Currently the web development field is HUGLEY congested. There are so many web devs and not enough jobs anymore.

This is however somewhat true for mobile development but with a huge difference. There are far less mobile developers(with many years of experience) than there are web developers. 

Mobile development has less competition and more companies are willing to hire junior mobile devs since there are not as many.

I have been tossing and turning this debate in my head for probably a decade! Whenever I consider the advantages of 'seamless workflow' between an iphone and a mac (disclaimer, I have a Macbook Air 2013), I consider the following:-

(a) To be totally 'seamless', you need an iphone, a mac, use Safari, and the Apple Cloud. Next, your friends should also have iphones/ Macs for the 'Airdrop' feature to function.

(b) If the above is not true, relatively adequate 'seamlessness' can be achieved ( which I did) through the Google ecosystem, and Firefox ( considering Chrome to be a privacy bug), and using Cryptomater to avoid Google prying into content on Drive:-

*    Firefox syncs passwords across devices - the phone and the laptop ( whether Mac or otherwise).
* Google Keep is a good basic Note taking app that syncs across devices.
* If you type anything on Word etc, you could save on One Drive/ Google Drive to find the document on the other device.

Ipso facto, the only thing left is the experience of typing on a device and continuing on the other without much attention ( If you pay attention, then problem is solved as you would save on Google Drive.

The cost of storage is less on Google Drive as compared to iCloud.

Thus, I have the Mac for the workflow, but probably am not leveraging the seamlessness. Probably I value the ability to jump ship more than pottering in the walled garden. To each his/her own!

Samsung camera and processing is amazing, and side by side there is NO comparison. All my testing is done with standard settings, not shot in RAW or anything. Screen brightness and quality is much better on Samsung.

Fit and finish, it's 50:50 so I wouldn't give anyone the edge there, both beautifully designed and machined devices.

Where Apple really shines is in the simplicity and ease of use of iOS. There is a lot of effort put into thoughtful UI/UX flow and interaction with applications, and a sense of uniformity. The continuity when using the Apple ecosystem is amazing, though Samsung is getting there with the Galaxy Experience. 

People talk a lot about software updates and versioning and longevity of support, but the differences is in the platform and framework so it's not truly a fair comparison. 

Android is open source, so Google publishes the new base every year which is more of a framework lift, and OEMs customize accordingly. In between, Google patches AOSP and provides those fixes to the OEMs which they build into their SMR (security maintenance releases) that are pushed monthly. Samsung, in this case, promises 5 years of security patches on all devices from date of launch. So my S23 Ultra which launched with Android 13 will get 14, 15, 16, 17, and monthly security patches all the way till 2028.

iOS updates are handled more of a need to know, and really only appear once exploits are identified and Apple fixes them. This is both good and bad, as exploits could live in the world much longer in the dark due to Apple's DCMA'ing of almost all reports that do not flow through Apple. IT admins and decision makers are not explicitly provided the CVE or patch ID to guarantee that a specific bug or exploit has been patched, other than ""Trust Us"".

Biggest things I miss from Android:

*  File system access. It is complete dogshit on iOS. I feel like I have no control over where my files go and how I can access them. In Android I had as much control as I do on my desktop. 
* Customization- the depth to which I could change things such as ringtone, notification sounds, backgrounds, lock screen functionality, the home screen... etc is lightyears behind on iOS. It's literally baffling. 
* Browser support/choices
* Keyboard functionality and choice. Even if you download a new keyboard on iOS, the defualt keyboard somehow always manages to rear its head in whenever it feels like it, and password input always changes to the default keyboard which is annoying as hell. 
* Interconnectivity between devices and file sharing. On Android if I wanted to send a file to my PC, to another phone, to a laptop, whatever, it was as easy as enabling bluetooth or just plugging it in, and vice-versa. On iOS it's a convoluted, nonsensical mess.
* Multitasking. On iOS if I answer a phone call it will sometimes just completely close the youtube or podcast app... etc. Many apps shut down after switching to another app, even if it's for a few minutes. Was never really an issue on the Note 8
* Overall freedom and control, which mirrors what I stated above, basically.

iPhone 3G -> iPhone 4 -> Samsung Galaxy S4 because iPhone 6-8 were really bad screen to physical size ratio -> Oneplus 3 -> iPhone XS because Android phones were getting too damn big -> iPhone 12 Mini -> Samsung Galaxy Fold 4.

The reason why I switched back to Android this time were:

- Microsoft discontinuing (at the time) Swiftkey, which was critical to my everyday typing because Apple still does not support prediction for my native language, Finnish. Apple's stock keyboard is frankly laughably bad and their bad custom keyboard support doesn't help.
- My iPad Pro 2017 slowly becoming a ""device non grata"" by missing out on things like Stage Manager support so I don't want to buy another one because I know Apple will pull this shit with future software features.
- iPhones kept getting bigger and bigger. The Fold 4 when folded is almost like a thick and tall iPhone 12 Mini in terms of physical size so I find it nice to work with when using one handed - like outside during the cold Finnish winter.

So for me it's been more a question of form factor. I'm super happy with the Fold 4 atm because it serves my needs for both phone and tablet all in one device. Apple doesn't make anything like it and I don't see myself getting another iPhone or iPad until they bring out their own foldable.

In terms of software, the Fold 4's Samsung keyboard is excellent. Very configurable, different setups for cover vs inner screen. I haven't even used Swiftkey on this because the prediction works great in every language I use. Multitasking is also better than iPad in the way it's easier to trigger, easier to set up the apps you need etc.

I'm positively surprised how far many Samsung apps have come where they are no longer just bloatware you want to remove but I actually use many of them. Samsung Health seems to be a bit better than what Apple offers based on my experience using it with my Galaxy Watch 4 vs my gf using the Apple Watch I got her for Christmas.

Samsung Dex also puts the iPad Pro + external screen + Stage Manager to shame, Dex can be a real desktop setup if I need one.

**What I miss about Android:**

Surprisingly not much now that iOS is closing the gap. Mainly minor nitpicks.

* How open and seamlessly connected everything is. On iOS everything feels like jumping in one bucket to another bucket. But on Android, it feels like one unified system. For instance, to open a Youtube link in an app on Android, most the time it'll go directly to the Youtube app. On iPhone, it'll open in the app browser, then you gotta click the icon to open in Safari, then in Safari you gotta click to open in the Youtube app banner at the top.

- Build quality is much better. Most of my android phones would get hardware issues after about a year and a half
- The way the phone integrates with Mac and iPads is great, makes things super easy.

What I like: the couple apps i wanted are supported. Camera is probably great but had zero complaints already.

What I dislike:

Battery is worse already and phone is 3 years newer. Never had battery or lag issues with phone, wife has dropped hers so much the lenses/camera no longer works.

Everything else.

Notifications, wtf is happening here?

horrible nav in general, iphotos sorting (again not allowing obvoius user control).

Its fat and weirdly shaped, note20 was slim. true for general appearance as well.

UI is slow and idk how to describe it, child like in appearance. Its not crisp at all.

All actions are tedious or more steps than necessary. Not easy to just adjust settings in app, always go to settings and 4 screens later to be told often, no you cant.

Keyboards suck, again, tedious and too many steps for simple things.

Controlling devices, wifi/bluetooth, settings in general a total pain.

Cant simply declutter home you have to move one by one, gd insanity.

No back button, back gesture exceedingly inconsistent and you can get stuck in apps. You sometimes have to open something to close things, and you cant close everything at once, again more work for something simple, which seems to be the ""design"" excellence you get.

iMessages is actually terrible, less info and intuitive than samsung. cant do obvious customizations without downloading more apps (true across the device). Cant seem to put the persons picture as a background?

You have to search the web to know how to do basic functions and often watch a video, download an app, for what would have been intuitive and in app settings (like change font in messages, nope, across whole device lol).

Allowing apps, photos, etc... to take up whole screen even up into the ""dynamic island"" (dont get me started) camera and noti bar, what is the point its cluttered and non functional ffs.

Cant believe Americans are so used to this they think its actually good design vs. simply being very used to something.

Keyboard doesnt have a 'down' button to get out the way when youre done, this is extremely convenient.

So many others, all related to slow, tedious or unnecessarily complicated menus, ""design"", etc...

Always trying to force you into their ecosystem. You cant set an alarm simply or have it labeled nicely without going into their annoying health app for example. How about let me set a gd alarm and leave me tf alone.

The recent announcements at WWDC21 provoked me to think about why I use the company’s products, so I thought I’d post here to ask what others reasons are, too. 

With iOS 15 around the corner, Apple is telling what I think is quite a profound story of technology increasingly blurring boundaries between devices. So is seamless connectivity what means so much to its users? Or is the product design? Many of the features of iOS aren’t the most innovative, at least at a high level (for example, Google Lens has been able to do what Live Text will soon be able to for a while now, as tech journalists and commentators have pointed out). So it is the quality of the software that appeals instead? Or is it because of habit? Or: is it all of the above, or entirely different reasons that I haven’t even hinted at?

No company is close to providing an experience like this.

The quality of apps is also another huge reason. Apps on iOS tend to offer a better user experience and are consistent in small design details.

* Longevity. I'm still on my iPhone 6s Plus. I'm typing this on an early 2015 Macbook pro. That's six years of still-supported products.

* Integration. I can share things really easily between my iPad and my wife's.

* Stability. Unlike Windows, I don't have to reboot all the time, and things just seem to work. Except podcasts, for some reason but that's a whole other story.

* Privacy. I feel more like the customer, not the product when I use Apple stuff compared to, say, Google.

* Ease of use. Procreate mixed with the Apple pencil 2 and iPad Air is a delight. It's like having an infinite sketchbook with me at all times. And I've now taken to reading kindle books on the iPad as well - the larger screen and ability to increase font sizes really helps my ageing eyes.

What I really don't like about Apple:

* They make decisions on my behalf that make life worse. No, Apple, given I'd already invested hundreds of pounds into wired headphones, I didn't want to get rid of the headphone jack. Yes, I really did like having usb slots in a laptop. On the contrary, I really do want to be able to 'share' a music file with another iPad.

I was reading their user interface guidelines, and they were showing how they do dialog boxes differently.  In a Windows system, it was Cancel or OK.

IOS,Unknown,0,"A lot of tech nerd kids can look at specs but there's one thing they often miss, and that's the economy of scale and how it affects R&D investments.

Apple products often sell over 10x more than any SINGLE product the competition offers (except the cheap low cost ones that aren't actually in competition with Apple products), this means apple can make more money yes, but also they can spend several times the money on R&D. The result of this won't show up as specs, because those things are usually just a matter of spending more per unit, rather I'll give some examples:

* the iPhone ALWAYS has the charging port dead center, cheap phones can have it shifted left or right, even Galaxy phones can have it shifted front/back and that's just stupid and ugly.
* The Macbooks likewise also has the ports dead center between the top and bottom edges of the side faces. Also all the type-C ports on a Macbook have identical function, you don't have one that's only for charging, or one that's faster than the rest because they can't be bothered to route everything on the PCB design.
* The Airpods don't have charging pins, the connectors just look like silver trims that's part of the design.
* Nothing comes even close to how good the backside of Apple Watches look. A lot of them just have an ugly stupid rectangular cut-out for the sensors.
* iPhone and Apple products in general have a complete end-to-end color management, if you only use Apple products then you're guaranteed all the color spaces are correct, and HDR content always correctly displayed. Android/Windows devices may technically support some of this stuff here and there, but it's always a mess and you can't be sure if something will display correctly. Google is especially guilty of not giving a fuck, chrome just doesn't care about your color profiles.
* It's 2021 and Android phones are still struggling to get an X/Y axis linear motor in their phones. Z-axis vibrations motors are just the worst.
* Regardless of how you feel about the butterfly keyboard, other manufacturers can't even afford to implement a completely new keyboard mechanism in their laptop, even if they wanted to.",1,positive,"Main object: Apple products

Apple airpods pro were revolutionary, i know more and more brands have excellent Noise cancelation now like the sony's. but it just works so well with each other.  


Yes Apple is expensive, limited, you get what you're given.

-	Subjective, but the general attitude seems to lean toward the opinion that the iOS SDK and the development environment in general is a lot better than trying to develop for Android. 
-	Most importantly, iOS users simply buy more things and shell out more money than android users.

IOS,exjr_,449294,"It's not ""hate"", per se, but it's just a couple of factors that make iOS be favorable. 

One of the reasons I've heard of, and one I understand is that it is easier to develop for 7 phones and a couple of iPads compared to developing for hundreds (if not thousands) of different Android devices. On iOS, you are essentially only developing/designing for 6-7 screen sizes, while this number is much larger for Android phones. 

Another reason I've read is that iOS brings in the money. It's super easy to pirate on Android, so developers that make paid games/app tend to favor iOS as Apple's restrictions makes it harder to pirate.

If you want to hear more ""voices"" about this, someone asked a similar question over at /r/iOSProgramming : https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/78qkc5/why_do_you_prefer_ios_over_android_development/",12,neutral,"Main object: iOS and Android

Of course this has a drawback too - in my experience, where a full app takes approx 200 human hours to complete for Android, it's somewhere between 280-340 hours for iOS to be the same level. It's mainly because some stuff that are simple in Android require considerably more work on iOS to work properly.

But at the end it boils down to money - Apple has a very strict market with a higher possibility of getting noticed, whereas Play Store itself is full of crApps - apps that are pure crap and should not exist, yet they do. And guess which pattern brings in more cash.

IOS,TAbramson15,257,"For me it’s multiple reasons, firstly the processors they make have been 3 years ahead of the top of the line Android chips since the A11 came out. And now the A17 Pro is even further ahead. Even the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is only as fast as the A13 from the iPhone 11 series.

Second reason is the better app experience hands down. The features and how they look and run are way better since the developers have less phones to code for on ios than on Android. Android gets a cookie cutter one size fits all app that lacks functionality and polish. Some Google apps on iOS even have more and better features than their native Android counterparts. 

Third reason is the build quality, the aesthetic of iPhones is far more appealing to me than anything Android has to offer, while also having the most durable glass and metal sandwich design on the market. Even Samsung’s S23 ultra is more fragile by far and has a major weakness with a curved display. 

Lastly everyone I know is on iPhone, my girl has one too and will never use an Android and we use FaceTime a lot while I’m working since we have a 5 month old daughter. The photo library sharing feature so we don’t have to send photos back and forth that we take of her, iMessage etc etc etc. 

To me with the processor being so far ahead, build quality, app polish/ experience, and connection to the people that matter to me, it feels like I get much more phone for the money since any Android flagship is close in price and if they aren’t then they’re severely lacking what I look for in a phone. Plus if I needed to, I could easily use my iPhone for 5-6 years and it would function beautifully still. An Android goes laggy and choppy and slow in a couple years tops. And lastly resale value. I get 800+$ back every year for my previous year iPhone toward the new one, an Android phone loses 60% of its original value the second you take it out of the box.. even a brand new sealed in the box Android phone from the previous year is worth 30-40% less than original. 

iPhone is just overall the better package for me. And this is coming from someone that since the 12 Pro Max, my iPhone is my only piece of tech, no tv, no laptop, no PC, no tablet, nothing but my phone so everything I do digitally, (tv and movies, games, socials, finance, files, photography and videography etc) is all on my phone and nothing else. Have done this on my 12 pro max, my 13 pro max and now my 14 pro max. iPhone is the best and most consistently good experience on a smartphone.

-as an Apple user already (iPad 4th gen (2012), iPod) being OS fragmented for the sake of screen size was a bit annoying. 

-stable updates (on Android, it takes a long time for updates, carrier sold (non unlocked by factory) devices are even worse. Process goes google tests -> manufacturer of device tests -> carrier optimizations. iPhone is seamless updates to everyone)

But i just can't go back to the subpar apps for some photo AI features that Google will probably end up adding into Google Photos anyway for everyone to use (yes, still paid for with Google One).

The biggest thing is I never had so many issue with running normal apps than I did with that phone. Things would crash and close not like a ton but way more noticeable than it never happening on my iPhone. Plus apps were just not optimized very well at all and pictures while great on the phone posted on apps like crap.

iPhone just gave me higher quality overall and update support for a long ass time. (currently iPhone X and Xs Max and still get updates)

IOS,gadgetroid,4108,"> I am growing weary of android. I have outgrown my tweaking days and I want a phone that works well out of the box

Yes, I sympathise with that. I love my 5s (yes, yes, I know it's old, but I really like small screen phones), but I still prefer my Moto G 2014 over my 5s. Here are my reasons why: 

1. iOS used to be the king of quality apps, but I think that has changed in the past few years. Sure, most apps and games are first released on iOS, but the thing is that after the introduction of Material Design on Android, the quality and feel of apps has changed leaps and bounds. We have better designed productivity apps, and we also have better Reddit apps than iOS – something I found really surprising when I made the switch to the iPhone last year. 

2. iPhones have great stand by time! I can go into class at 8:30 am with 100% battery and come out at 1 pm with 99% battery. That's phenomenal! Sure, Android has Doze and Doze OTG, but they never really seem to work as well as iPhone's standby time. But, Android devices have better SoTs, and I'd take that any day over better standby time. I don't get why Apple have to design thin phones. Sure, there might have been a need for it when the Nokia 5800 and the Nokia N8 were bulky smartphones, but that time has come to pass surely? 

3. Very limited OS. I have enjoyed sideloading eBooks and whatnot on my Android devices and then opening them in an app I prefer to use. But on iOS, while I can sideload files into certain apps, I can hardly use those same files on other apps. Or share them to other devices for that matter. Have an interesting PDF or ePUB to send? Well, you'll have to wait until you get to your MacBook so you can share that over email or whatever to a friend. I would like it if iOS would grant access to the file system so that we could at least have control over what we put in our phones. Oh, and do you want to sideload movies? Well, best of luck doing that if you don't want to open your MacBook (or PC), load up iTunes (a nightmare for anyone), and then transfer it over. No SSH access or whatever until you jailbreak. What a bummer. 

> Android manufacturers tend to throw every resource they have on hardware but if google/android is the problem itself then what would improve in the years that follow?

More than Google/Android, it's the OEM skins that are the problem. Sure, they add value, but that's at the cost of performance. Not everybody has money (or want to spend that much even if they do) to buy flagships, and skins take a major hit on performance on mid range phones like the Redmi series or Huawei's Honor phones. I'm not a stock ""shill"" – I love MIUI very much, but putting it over Android? I don't think that's the solution. If you want to make a difference and offer value as an Android OEM, you need to do it like Motorola used to do, or like Nokia is now planning on doing.",147,neutral,"Main object: Android

While the iPhone could afford to lose some bezel, I don't think it's that big a deal.  The focus on smaller and smaller bezels is about to become as useless as Apple's fixation on making everything thinner and lighter.

My primary pain point with iOS is the inability to set default apps.  Specifically, I'd want to do this for Email, Calendar, Browser, and Maps at the very least.  My business runs on G Suite, and I don't want to feel like I'm swimming against the tide while I'm trying to get work done.

The rest of the issues are mostly minor gripes, but they add up.  Things like the control center being stupidly designed (at least for me, and my uses) and inflexible.  Notifications need an overhaul.  App settings are a bit of a mess.

Apple's update cadence is similar to Intel's ""tick-tock"" of le old days: major hardware changes on the big number release, under-the-hood changes on the S release. With the upcoming revision, however, I'm not so sure, as the rumor mill appears to point towards more than just a S release this year.

Then again, until the next revision is officially unveiled, it's all just rumors at this point, no need to put too much money on them.

The iPhone is doing better now, but the first four generations were holding back the entire market with regards to technology and innovation to the extent Samsung and HTC were in talks of a merger of their mobile-operations in order to ""conquer"" IOS to prevent the stalling (of innovation) of the industry and to allow customers technologies that already exist today...

I don't really care how good the new iPhone is. The fact is that Apple have shown time and again that they have no intention on furthering the state of mobile devices or improving the industry.

Apple doesn't give me this sense at all. Apple makes me think it is run by a sociopath who has no need for trivial matters such as making other peoples' lives better or financial gain - I genuinely believe Tim Cook and his cronies have fun toying with the population through shit product ideas that his loyal army of sheeple will praise, just so he can sit back with a glass of wine at the end of the day and watch the salt flow in message boards and posts such as this one.",2,negative,"Main object: Apple and its products

I had the Nexus 6P when I went to grab the iPhone 7. The size of it is great, although I wish the screen took up more of the body. The overall feel of the iPhone is pretty much perfect. It's a large factor of why I go back to it. The OS is...Usable. I like to use it because it is so simple that it keeps me off my phone. I really only use my iphone for a fraction of the things that I'd use my Android phones for. 
It's different. 

Then came the Pixel. Immediately I loved the Pixel, the speed was just far superior than any other Android device I've ever touched. The only downside was how big the phone was. I stayed on my Pixel for a couple months and then started to switch back and forth between the two phones. 

Currently I've been using the iPhone 7 as my primary phone. I love the feel of it, and iMessage is pretty great. 

It isn't the hardware that Apple really needs to work on, it's more the software. As where for Android it is definitely more of the hardware side that needs working on. 

Now they both have to work on hardware and software, as neither are perfect. But that's just my experience with both the iPhone 7 and the Pixel as an idea.

___

No, and it's because I honestly think Apple has better hardware than Android. The fact that they make both the phone and the hardware gives them an edge on any Android phone for performance (for the most part). There are 2 main reasons I won't switch to Apple:

1. I just don't like the look of iOS. I don't like the lack of an app drawer and that all apps have to be on the screen. I like my android home to have no icons other than the launch bar, and maybe a google/spotify widget on the top.

2. The bigger reason is options. I like having multiple phones to choose from for the current generation of phone, rather than 2 different sizes of the same phone. Just the other day I was talking to my friend about the new iPhone and how it's rumored that it will have a button on the back, which he absolutely hates. He said he'll still get the phone because he wants the newer generation, but he'll be upset if the buttons on the back. This is the biggest thing, I personally prefer the button on the back so I can find a current gen phone that fits my needs. For other android users who don't like the button there (plebs /s) they can find many current gen phones without it. Android allows you to find a phone that fits your specific needs.",2,neutral,"1.

Apple makes such quality products with amazing customer service, but with their success has come a hubris that they always know best, that their products are always superior to third party alternatives, and that sensible defaults should even overrule any alternative.

First of all, most of the flagship Android phones are loaded with bloatware and take a while to customize to your liking (I'm looking at you, Samsung). I currently own a Nexus 5, and even though I can upgrade for free, I think I'm going to stick with this phone because it is the iPhone of Androids. What do I mean by that? Well.. out of the box it just felt like an iPhone: I entered my gmail address and all of the sudden my phone was 100% synched with my life... I can scan documents to my drive in 2 clicks, pictures sync to my photos... it really feels just as convenient as my last iPhone did. iPhones all have the same hardware and (if you have the latest or 2nd latest one) the OS is made EXACTLY for that hardware and that hardware only. The experience is smooth, and I can see why people like my older family members swear by their iPhones - they're just so easy to ""get"".    

As long as it satisfies my needs and my budget, I have zero commitment to any brand. The inherent problem with Android (and advantage with apple) is that there are so many manufacturers and all this hardware needs to (somehow) be compatible with one operating system.

-iOS. I hate how iOS devices are becoming worthless in secured corporate environments with MDM software since apple is restricting what can be controlled.

-iTunes: Everyone knows this. It's one of the worst, cumbersome, buggy, and all around shitty example of shipped software ever. Even on OSX

-iOS Configurator: This works okay for some of the functions of iTunes. For wiping and updating a phone, it's almost useless. I end up with used phones dropped off on my desk with no PIN for me to log into it. So I just want to wipe it, but iOS configurator wants to download the latest iOS, install it, and then wipe the phone. No, they aren't going to keep the last download I somehow managed to do the same day for the exact make and color of the phone. It wants to download the entire update again and if it fails, like it does 70% of the time, it starts over.

-iCloud: there is no stopping this, not even through MDM. Users will always log their own iTunes account into this and ALWAYS claim ""I never did that, I think you put that on there"" fuck you, yes you did. That's YOUR personal email.

i do love apples universal chatting stuff though.  android's inability to stick with apps is driving me insane.  certain apps cant be replaced by a random app when you dont like it... and things like messaging is one of those.  everyone has to use the same thing in order for it to work.  google sucks for this.  however, apple could also very easily say, hey, here is an imessage app for android... which would solve the problem, but understandably, apple will not do that.",1,neutral,"Main object: IOS and Android

Hardware is (mostly) fine. The screens suck compared to what I'm used to, it sucks not having a headphone jack, the battery life is great. Performance in a day to day setting, you don't even notice.

The software, however, is a completely different story. There's nothing really *wrong* about it, but I can't wait til I move back to Android. It's death by a million paper cuts, is how I look at it.

When I first started using it, there was a small learning curve, but that was nothing a quickly overcome. It's all the little quirks that drove me nuts. Not being able to edit a word from the inside, having to delete the entire word and retype it. Notifications are abysmal. Their quick access drawer is pretty much useless (having sliders in a swiped tray, honestly?). Not being able to change defaults. No, I don't want to open this with Apple Maps. No, I don't want to use your keyboard for the billionth time, why do you keep changing back to it? Siri is the most retarded assistant I've ever used.

The hardware wasn't ever really a problem. The screen was nice enough, the fingerprint reader was handy, the camera was good.

The problem was the software. The things I thought I would be annoying... the UI, the lack of choice for default apps and customization, etc... were as annoying as I expected, but the things I thought would be 'good enough' that I could get used to having an iPhone...  user experience... were actually the worst. The autocorrect was brutal. How many times do I need to delete your autocorrect suggestion before your stupid software will stop autocorrecting it? If my bluetooth headset was connected, and I answered a phone call, you'd think the call would go to the headset... and you'd be wrong. I can't tell you how many times I had to yell at the person on the other end to hold on for a second while I switch the call to my headset. And don't even get me started on iTunes. Just stupid.

It's been a little over a year since I finally gave up the iPhone for... drum roll please... a BlackBerry Priv, and I was happy as a pig in shit. I'm now on a 128 GB Pixel and couldn't be happier.

iOS to me...is just...lacking. in almost every category. You can't jailbreak as easy, there isn't device freedom, you can't install 3rd party apps, you can't replace stock features, you can't do a LOT of things. To me it's like buying a Ferrari but you aren't given the key. So yeah it's pretty and you can say you have a Ferrari, but you don't get to use it to it's full potential unless you jailbreak, voiding the warranty, and that's IF the software you're running supports it and if your processor supports it. 

There's also too many hoops. Wanna get photos off of your iPhone? I hope you have a Mac because if you don't you have to pay for a 3rd party app to do it. Wanna put music on your phone?

* As I've gotten older, I've found I just want something that ""works"".  I find myself less interested in tweaking and hacking with my device.  I was also a person who rooted, ROMed and everything else.  I do miss that a little bit, particularly when you STILL can't tell something like Messages to open a damned link in Chrome instead of Safari. 
* iMessage is just *NICE*.  Why be Google and launch a new app every week when you can have one that just does everything you want.
* I got SOOO sick of the rigmarole required to keep battery life decent.  Turn off GPS, uninstall any social media apps, turn down brightness to 25%, hold phone at exactly a 49 degree angle .  My iPhone is at 82% after a 12 hour day of listening to music and browsing reddit.  I have Facebook installed too.

That last one is probably the #1 thing for me.  I get so sick of having to gimp the hell out of my phone just to make it to bedtime without having to recharge.  

The downsides:

* iCloud is a joke compared to the Google landscape.  Everything in Google just works so nicely together.  With iCloud and gmail, etc, you constantly feel like you are shoehorning things together.  With Google, what I see on my phone is what I can see from a webpage, etc. 
* Apps are just terrible on Apple.  You essentially lack any real choice. The handful of first party apps  are amazing, but if you stray away from those at ALL, you get into shit-zone apps.  That's different than the Google App landscape. Maybe the first party apps aren't as great, but you have a whole bunch of really decent alternatives before you get into the shit-zone ones.  

I mean, it's pretty bad when the native Reddit app is probably one of the better iOS reddit apps. Android just has SOOOO many other great alternatives like Bacon, Relay, etc.  I hate Narwhal and Beam is only OK, and the one I use.  The situation is like that all over iOS.

For me it's actually been the opposite. I've used both for years but recently I've taken to Android for my daily driver. There's so many issues I have with Apple's current product portfolio, and so many outdated design philosophies with iOS, I just don't enjoy using their stuff as much as I used to. Which is sad, because I use their stuff every single day as part of my job (software engineer).

IOS,jkslate,262,"tldr: Old Android user that thinks iphones dont need better hardware to temp people to switch, because their hardware works so much better.


As an android guy that went iphone; I prefer my iphone7 over any android phone now. I had the S8 for 2 days before paying $35 to restock it and going back to the iphone. 

My reasoning is thus; 
In the two days I had the S8 it crashed an app 4 times. No big deal, just reload the app and all works well. That being said, in the 6 months I owned a 6s and the few months I owned a 7 I have had maybe 1 app crash. 

Even on the S8 there is UI stutter, its kinda ridiculous. iOS is smooth as butter, even on older phones.

Battery life, thats right, I said it. I wake up and get to work 45 minutes early and watch netflix in my car while I drink my coffee. 30-45 minutes of netflix will eat up **1 freakin percent** of my battery life, that is crazy. I will then do one of two things, either let my phone sit in my pocket until break, inwhich I will still have 95% + battery. Every single android I had would be around 85ish% at this point. 

Or I will run imusic non-stop streaming to my bluetooth headphones, at which point my phone will be at 85% for breaktime. 

This battery life simply CRUSHES android, regardless of the phone. The one time that android batteries actually make a difference is when you are heavily using the phone, web browsing, gaming, etc. The larger android batteries really shine at that point, but for all background work and netflix, iphones are exceptionally efficient battery users.

I never monitor my battery on an iphone, I'm CONSTANTLY wondering what stupid rogue app has gone vampire on my android battery. That reason alone is almost enough reason for me to choose iphone.

That being said! God is the S8 screen gorgeous.  I'm excited for the iphone8 simply for that damn screen, I do miss AMOLED screens. But hey, that iphone screen isn't really bad or anything, it still looks nice.

What this long post is saying, don't let the specs fool you. My iphone is superior in almost every way that matters FOR ME.

Also being a developer makes me understand some (not all) of the reasons Android's efficiency is usually lower - the OS simply does more things. It's IPC API makes it very easy for different apps to communicate with each other, something that's always a pain on iOS.

But would I be as happy or effective with it as I am with Android if I had to use it on a daily basis? Absolutely, positively not, and it comes down to a simple question:

Do you want an appliance that does specific things in specific ways and generally does them well? Or do you basically want a PC in your pocket and all the flexibility that comes with that? 

If you want the former then get an iOS device and you'll be quite happy. If you want the later though then don't even consider iOS. 

Do I have direct access to the file system and can I do all the management things I do on my PC? Yes for Android, no for iOS. 

Can I change the entire interaction model of my device? Vis a vis custom launchers? Yes for Android, no for iOS. 

Can I plug my device into my PC and treat it like an external hard drive? Yes for Android, no for iOS. 

Can I easily install apps that don't come from the One True Source for apps? Yes for Android, no for iOS. 

Can my device generally and easily interact with other devices that aren't of the same make? Yes for Android, (largely) no for iOS. 

Can I tweak the device in numerous ways to make it work how *I* want it to work rather than the manufacturer? Yes for Android, (largely) no for iOS. 

And I can do all of this without rooting or any sort of ""hacking"" because it's the fundamental philosophy behind the device. Android is MINE and bends to MY will. To be in the Apple ecosystem means bending to THEIRS... and for some people that's not at all a bad thing, but it's still a thing.

My 6s Plus can last for days even when I'm using hotspot tethering frequently/constantly. 

LCD: Having the 6s Plus, I thought I'd notice that the screen is only 1080p. I don't. I don't see the pixels, it's very clear and I have zero issues and I've got very good vision. My previous Android device had an AMOLED display at 1440p and it was a bit smaller than this one. I honestly think the iPhone is has a better display. 

I realize you're comparing the 7 to an Android phone but the ones my wife and I have are the same format but include the headphone jack.

IOS,SanityInAnarchy,8531,"> Their obsession with thinness that made battery capacity small. The smaller iphone has 1900+ mah battery. In android, that capacity would be a joke of a phone but due to ios's optimizations, it can go toe to toe with the smaller android flagships.

I suspect this depends largely on what you run on Android -- my Pixel can last 2-3 days on a charge, still.

> Second, their a10 chip already blows every android chipset out of the water so i do not know why they stuck with hd and full hd resolution. The small phone should be full hd and the big phone should be quad hd.

...why? 4K is barely noticeable on a living-room-sized screen, and you already can't resolve individual pixels on most decent phone screens -- that's the whole point of that ""Retina"" brand, right? -- so all this would do is burn battery life and bandwidth in favor of bigger numbers.

If Apple put 4K in a phone, it would make me *less* likely to switch.

> Huge chins Again a major turnoff but it might be killed in the future

I don't hate the Pixel's chin as much as I thought I would, but I do hate Apple's hardware home button -- in particular, I hate that the fingerprint scanner is there, instead of on the back. I understand why they did it this way -- I have coworkers who keep unlocking their phones with PINs instead of the fingerprint reader because they forget it's there, and that's hard to do when it's built into the home button. But once you learn to use the one on the back, it's so much better!

> Selfie camera and microphone For some reason, samsung's older s7 has a wider selfie camera than the newer iphone 7 and the mic sounds more muffled than on the galaxy s7.

Honestly don't care.

Here's the minimum it would take to convince me:

* USB-C. Not optional. Even Macbooks have it, why is Apple hanging onto Lightning?
* More customization in iOS -- SMS has to be iMessage, web has to be Safari, etc. (There aren't really other browsers on iOS -- I mean, yeah, you can download Chrome on iOS, but it has to use Safari to display Web content.)
* Cross-platform XCode. I already don't like iOS, but I also don't like OS X, and I especially don't want to have to buy a Mac just to be able to write an app.
* Faster animations. I'm serious -- last time I used an iPhone, their animations were smooth enough, but stuff like the home button is *insanely* slow compared to anything Lollipop or above on Android.

I'd also like to see them bring back the headphone jack, but I don't care *that* much. And I'd feel much better if there was an open source release. But notice, by far most of this is software -- there are things I don't like about Apple's hardware, but I can't argue that they make good hardware.

Things that periodically tempt me:

* For all its flaws, it seems like you actually can just back up an entire iPhone to iCloud. Android's backup requires every app developer to opt in, which makes upgrading a nightmare -- and since Android's hardware support lasts 3 years at the very longest, you have to go through this often!
* Speaking of: Longer hardware support. You could securely buy a new phone every 5 years, instead of every 3 years. Or, I could buy a new phone every year and give last year's model away, and not feel guilty about inflicting an unpatched phone on someone else.
* A reasonable selection of mobile games, though this is improving dramatically on Android. But it's rare to find a mobile game that's even on par with something like Hearthstone, and many of the actually-interesting ones are iOS-only.
* As much as I hate Apple's behavior with iMessage, that's a fairly large, fairly popular communications app that I can't have on Android -- but stuff like Hangouts and Whatsapp usually make it to iOS, if they don't *start* there.",1,neutral,"Main object: IOS and Android

Battery life: this came as a shock for me. I have a 6s plus so I can't speak for the smaller iphone. But battery life has been excellent overall. I rarely end the day with a dead phone, even after a year of charge cycles. 

Updates. Obvious pro of the iPhone

Surprisingly, lack of quick charge is a pro for me. 
I have had 2 Android phones with quick chargers and after about 6 months both of them had battery lives that were about halved. I would say after about a year my phone lasts about 80% as long as it did brand new out of the box. This is definitely inconvenient if I ever forget to plug my phone in overnight but 99% of the time this is a pro for me. 
 
By far the fastest phone I've ever owned. 
I may catch a little heat for saying this. And I know what the specs are on paper, but this phone never misses a beat. Slowdown and stutter is almost non existent (only occurs when low power mode is on) 
Still runs as fast as the day I bought it as well. 

CONS:
Customization. This really is the main reason to choose Android if you're into that. 

Screen. The IPS display is very high quality, but goddamn I miss the colors my Nexus 6's screen could display, and those deep blacks... Overall the iPhones display is pretty good, but you would expect something a little better for the price. 

Fragility: Android phones in general are more durable. The iPhone is slippery, the aluminum can scuff easily and the glass is very thin. Always have a case and screen protector. 

Overall I am glad I made the switch. This phone does everything I need it to. There are occasions where I miss android, or will hear of a new Android phone that sounds rather compelling, but those moments are few and far between and I don't regret switching much at all.",1,positive,"Main object: iPhone

I have an iPhone 5s at home, and now and then switch to it for fun, but how sharing is handled in iOS as compared to android, really bothers me. For example, I can click any of my files, click share and select pretty much any of my communications app, select my friend and send. Done. With iOS I have to do it from the app, and deal with whatever system that app uses. 

The lack of a proper file explorer also gets annoying at certain points. 

I can't stand having to use iTunes to transfer files, getting a video file from my laptop to my iPhone is a multistep process, which concludes with a slow transfer. On my Moto z play is just click and drag, I can even use it as a thumb drive and move files that the phone doesn't recognise.

I love having an app drawer and leaving only my most used apps on the home screen, I know its seems weird since many consider android more complicated, but i find iphone homescreen just so cluttered and disorganized. I hate it. 

Next, and this is HUGE for me, but probably so small I doubt anyone else has even mentioned it of the thousands of posts here. In android if you start typing someones name on the dial pad, it will predictively give you options from your contacts. I FUCKING LOVE THIS. i love this so much and it saves so much time that even though I have a work phone, if the contact is in both my phones i will 100% always pull out my android phone. its so much faster than cycling through contacts, its so much better then typing a search in with a full keyboard. its super fantastic and always works and its NOT ON IPHONE.",1,negative,"Main object: iPhone and Android

It's the software I despise. The fact that it doesn't group notifications, and doesn't tell you you have notifications on the top bar (instead opting to show me which network I'm on, like that ever changes), and you can't do stuff to a notification without opening the app, or even read the rest of the notification!

Then there's the fact that on android you can set apps as default for a certain action, while on iOS you're locked in to whatever's apple's solution. OK Google is heaps better than Siri, partly for this reason. OK Google can do stuff with third party apps, Siri can not. (Unless apple has an agreement with the app developer, and that's only in certain cases)

One thing I really liked about androids was that you could customize them almost endlessly, and as you mentioned, there's a bunch of different manufacturers with their own flavors of android. However, I've noticed that no matter how big the phones battery was, it would struggle to make it through the day, even when I tried using it as sparingly as possible. On top of this, my brand new phone would work stunningly for all of 3-5 months before slowing down significantly, not to the point of not wanting to use it, but it would just slow down and not feel like the premium phone it was meant to be. Mind you, I'm not someone who downloads everything and anything on the Play Store or online to ruin my phone, I would keep it simple and just get a few social networking apps, a music app, maybe some small games.

But every time I've had an iPhone, it would keep working almost just as fast as it was the day I bought it. Even when it would be low on storage space and constantly yell at me to free storage, it would run super smooth. 
On top of this, despite the batteries having small capacities in total, my iphones battery would tend to last significantly longer than any of my android powered phones. 

I understand not really liking the UI and certain aspects of the software, I totally don't blame you on certain aspects. The phone can be annoying to use at times.

I had a jailbroken iphone 6S, I tend to find stock ios very limiting in terms of what you could do, I mean theres a way around certain things like app tweaks etc through developer profiles but overall it felt very locked on stock where as once jailbroken the phone was a lot more enjoyable to use especially with some of the developers in the jailbreak community which really push some cool tweaks out which make the phone better. However, the battery was a big negative for me and that kinda tempted my move to android along with the camera. I found it was difficult to take good photos on android without a camera tweak since there was no pro mode settings initially on the device, albeit I am no pro photographer but I love messing around and getting some good shots. 

So around 3 weeks ago my S8 came, now this is my first android phone. It took a little getting used too, but the phone feels so much more open straight out the box being able to do what I want (mostly). The screen is probably my most favourite feature along with how good the camera is. My only gripe I have to say with android software is some of the IOS shortcuts not translating and I can't find a way to enable them like tapping the top bar to scroll up to the top, a now playing widget to be dragged from somewhere are a few that come to mind.

IOS,CisternaChyli,0,"I was actually tired of Android and it's myriad bugs and issues, especially with my old Note 5. What drove me over the edge was a bug in which Chrome would freeze, heat up and eventually crash the Note 5 because it uses an Exynos processor. If Google and Samsung couldn't get their act together on one of the premier phones running Android, then what was the point of using it? It was my third replacement phone as well. My first one had the ""NO SIM"" error and the second one would just overheat randomly. This could have been due to the aformentioned bug. It's sad cause I really enjoyed Android and I had been using it since early 2011. I had the pleasure of owning a Galaxy S3 (and ROM'ing it) and I really liked my Note 5 in the beginning, but all the issues cropped up. I thought of doing the unthinkable, jumping over to iOS and the iPhone. I think what made it a bit easier is that I had already owned Apple products (Mac and iPad). I thought I wasn't gonna like the iPhone 7 Plus when I switched, but I really have been enjoying the experience. iOS is solid. I know that the customization is very limited, but it just works, day in and day out. I don't have to worry about sudden battery drains, turning services off, running low power mode, etc, etc.  I can use the phone to its full potential and still get at least 24 hrs of battery life. There is some semblance of access to the file system if you download Documents 5. That's really all the access that I need. iMessage kicks ass and the continuity features between the iPhone and Mac are wonderful to use and experience. Nowadays, I pretty much use my MacBook Pro whenever I'm at home, because I can use iMessage from it and take calls as well. The WhatsApp app for MacOS works great too. I've actually gotten used to the swiping guesture to go back, but mostly I just hit the home button to bring up the recent apps carousel. Obviously there are things in iOS that need fixing, like the notification system and the inability to change default apps. 

As for the 7 Plus hardware, it's top notch. Apple Pay works, every time without fail, unlike Samsung Pay. The IPS LCD, while still being old tech, was pushed to it's limit by Apple with the wide gamut color technology being used this year. It's the best LCD I've seen in a phone, but Apple knows this is the LCD's zenith. I'm excited to see what Apple will do with AMOLED, now that it's a mature technology. The iPhone is super fast and scrolling is always smooth as well. I'm really liking the dual camera and it's ability to do the bokeh effect. Picture quality is pretty much a wash with my old Note 5 and in fact, it's better in low light as compared to my friend's old Galaxy S7 edge. I have no complaints about the image quality but I know Apple can always keep improving. The taptic engine in the 7 is pretty neat as well, as well as the solid home button. I guess it's Apple's way of getting us prepared to move to the under screen home button and TouchID. 

I played with a S8+ recently at the Verizon store and while it was nice, in fact very nice....and to be honest, I did miss Android briefly. I know my 7 plus looks outdated compared to the S8+ but I know it's software is solid and the phone won't let me down. It feels great in hand too.

- fast updates
- long-lasting phone (ok, some will disagree with me but a lot of people around me are still using the iPhone 4S, 5 or 5C/5S (2011, 2012, 2013), I really love the idea of giving my phone that still has updates to a family member whereas my 2012 Nexus 4 doesn't even have Android 6)
- full stock experience (this one is VERY important to me, I don't want touchjeez or HTC Sense or whatever, I want a full stock experience, like Nexus or Pixels. iPhones don't have bloatwares)
- privacy (ok this one is a little bit special. I want to use things like Siri or Google Assistant but I don't want to share everything I do with Google. Just check-out apple.com/privacy and then check-out google.com/privacy, not the same at all, Google shouldn't need a map of all my movements and recordings of my voice just to respond to ""what's the weather like today?"".)
- default apps (on Android, I have a Play Store full of apps, which ones do I use ? Stock Google Messenger, stock Dialer, stock Chrome browser, stock camera app, stock alarm clock etc. I tried A LOT of sms apps, alarms apps, browsers, I always go back to the Google one's, don't know why. Choice is an excellent thing, but it's not going to cry if I can't change the default apps)
- Just. Works.
- Real, painless back ups (even if I have to use iTunes, don't care)
- Integrations with my other equipments (I have a Chromebook, it seems like the two devices are from totally different companies (well, they are, but not their OS), I also have a Mac, and the Integrations between my girlfriend's iPhone and the Mac is just awesome.)

I understand the power users like me are a few only, and are difficult to satisfy, but fuck off. The moment they started making Mac OS a big phone OS for dummies and obfuscated all complexity it was just about time to switch sides.

I remember I struggled once to just turn off the MBP display while connected to the TV. I had to create a damn shell script to do it. For God's sake.

I still miss some of the Mac OS greatness, but I have never regretted my decision, specially after the big fiasco for the pros with Aperture and the laughable Mac Pro situation.

Apple does not want to create a great OS, Apple wants to create a profitable and beautiful OS. 
They don't want to create powerful tools, but beautiful tools, like the useless ultrathin gold-champagne mono-port monstruosity of a laptop.

IOS,altimax98,32225,">Apple is using ips lcd. If they switched to amoled, battery life would be better no question about it.

Not really. The APL (Average Picture Level) needs to be 65% or lower to see a benefit for AMOLED and since a lot of iOS is white I don't think you would see much of a benefit. Now that can change if a dark mode ships with iOS11.

>Second, their a10 chip already blows every android chipset out of the water so i do not know why they stuck with hd and full hd resolution. The small phone should be full hd and the big phone should be quad hd.

Don't confuse CPU and GPU. If you compare the GPU's between the S8 and iPhone 7 there is not a whole lot of disparity between the numbers. Remember, you need to look at Offscreen for a true comparison. While looking at Offscreen numbers they are close, and one could deduce from those numbers that pushing QHD on the A10 would strain the GPU and likely push it right up to the point of not running as fluidly as they expect. Also keep in mind that iOS needs 1X/2X/3X to run properly so QHD would be a higher resolution than 1440p. An iOS device exceeding 1440P (or QHD) would have to run at 1,656 x 2,944 which is slightly more than the Galaxy S8 has to render at 1,440 x 2,960. 

>Huge chins Again a major turnoff but it might be killed in the future

Agreed

>Selfie camera and microphone For some reason, samsung's older s7 has a wider selfie camera than the newer iphone 7 and the mic sounds more muffled than on the galaxy s7.

This is still baffling. The iPhone *still* records in mono which causes this lack of depth in audio. The only issue with wide selfie cams that literally no one talks about is shape distortion. In fact Samsung devices have a setting to help stop that from occurring. I understand why Apple is hesitant from doing this yet.",0,neutral,"Main object: Comparison between iOS and Android

Live Stickers? Seems cool but currently crashes iMessage sending it to older iOS that doesn't support it.

Haven't tried the rest yet but overall, these are really quality of life improvements more so than a major version release to me, this should been a 16.5 not 17 and 17 should have been a bigger change overall.

They definitely know everyone’s been using the Siri Shortcuts method of changing our app icons and stuff and doing them the hard way one by one.. you’d think with how popular that was they’d give us their version of a theme store that people can upload free or paid icon packs to so we can change it at the tap of a button. It doesn’t even have to be as inclusive as Samsung’s version where when they download a theme it changes all the UI elements and colors too, Im sure we’d be happy just to have a quick one button press icon pack store.. 🤦🏻‍♂️ if they do this and allow more customization of the Home Screen, Android would go under water cause iOS would finally have the features needed to make even more people come over to iOS. iOS is already better in every other way aside from that, better updates, better performance, better and more consistent animations and smoothness of the OS.. better app experience, etc. people have already been flocking to iOS more this year than in the past decade cause of the Lock Screen update, imagine if they gave us Home Screen updates and customization? Android would have a tough time keeping their fan base besides the die hards lol. Even people that have only ever used Android are coming to iOS at rates higher than ever as is..

IOS,SimShade,10313,"My favorite feature by far is StandBy. I personally got [this stand](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Magnetic-Wireless-Included-Compatible/dp/B092PWGCYX/ref=sr_1_4?crid=Q5Y4MVJ9JBU2&keywords=Belkin%2Bmagsafe%2Bstand&qid=1686085036&sprefix=belkin%2Bmagsafe%2Bstand%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-4&th=1) ahead of time just for this feature. The only other feature that can overtake it is interactive widgets. If a Now Playing widget gets implemented natively or by a third-party developer, I will LOVE that.

The only feature that requires a learning curve for me is the enhanced autocorrection and predictive text, namely on iPadOS 17. As I’m typing on this right now, I’m seeing the little predictive hints pop up but it’s not instinctual for me to press Tab just yet. Hopefully I’ll be able to adapt to it. 

While I don’t use iMessage much nor FaceTime, I’m excited for the iMessage features like swipe to reply, transcribed voice notes, filtered searches, etc. Also, custom stickers from pictures on any app is really cool.

One thing I need clarity on is “stepping away when using AirDrop”. Does that mean you can walk away from your device and AirDrop will still be running or does that mean you can lock it and it’ll still run? If it’s the former, I thought that’s how it always was. If it’s the latter, *that’s* really cool — especially for big files.

I can see why Find My Item Sharing is a big deal for people but I myself don’t really care for that since I only have one AirTag and one family member that uses an iPhone. Still cool though.

Apart from that, I’m neither disappointed nor excited for the rest.",1,positive,"Main object: iOS

take all this with a grain of salt. I'm basing my opinions off the picture in this post, because i didn't watch the apple Livestream


1. No more hey

honestly its just going to make people's phones go off more often. they already get plenty of false starts so now they're probably going to get more


2. Shared item tracking

Could actually be useful, say you know someone near your item you could send the location to them. though i doubt it will have any compatibility with android, as does everything apple 😐


3. pets albums

Google Photos has had this for years, apple's late


4. standby

i can't tell what this is


5. contact banners

honestly looks a little gimmicky, but it could turn out interesting


6. offline maps

Google Maps already has this


7. check in

i can't tell what this is


8. name drop

first one that looks really interesting. hoping this comes to android, and if at all possible, works between systems, though this is apple we're talking about, so that's probably not happening


9. live stickers

gifs with extra steps? not entirely sure if that's all it is though


10. live voicemail

Android already has this


11. improved autocorrect

i personally don't use autocorrect at all, so this doesn't really mean anything to me


12. journal

just a journal? don't you already have a notes app? not sure what it means


13. swipe to reply

Google added this to their messaging platform recently. since most of my texts are with people who use iphone, i don't get to use it (thanks apple😐)


14. leave a facetime message

so a video? that's all it looks like, is just send a video

IOS,Anthokne,1918,"Such a waste of a feature for live voicemail. There's a jailbreak tweak that blows this out of the water and it's been available for years. It works similar to having a tape recorder answering machine in your home back in the day. 

Someone calls (you can choose specific voicemail greetings to play for specific contacts, general calls, and private callers), then you can tap to listen to the message they're leaving while they're leaving it and choose to pickup the call whenever you want. 

I'm so so disappointed every time apple steals an idea from the jailbreak community and totally nerfs it. 

•Colour in the music app based on the album artwork- Was a Jailbreak tweak first, and more customizable. 

•SBsettings- control centre before iPhone had control centre. The original tweak is more customizable than our current control centre. 

Honestly I could go on for hours listing things. I just don't like the fact that you have to choose either amazing QOL tweaks and customization for your phone but suffer having to stay a year or more behind on IOS versions. 

Or you're stuck with using apples take on things, and having to deal with limitations, but get the shiny new features right away.

IOS,Randomhuman114,1,"I agree about the status icons. Really nice. But I don’t see how having controls integrated into the notification center is actually more practical than having a separate control pannel. If you want to see your notifications, you can go to the notification center with one swipe. If you want to access the device controls, you can go to the control pannel swipe. It seems much more cohesive and practical to me.

Also, you don’t really have to swipe up to see the notification center in iOS, it hasn’t been that way since 16.5 I believe. The moment you open your notifcation center all the notifications appear. You do have to swipe to see old notifications in the lock screen but… That makes a lot of sense, since those are notifications you already saw.

Aside from the status bar, which is genuinely great and very useful, I actually think iOS has more features to manage notifications efficiently if you take the time to set it up. The fact that you can get notified only of direct messages and time sensitive notifications and send everything else to a scheduled summary is extremely useful, and Focus modes are amazing as well to get only the notifications that are important at the moment.

I’ve been asking a lot of people what’s really so superior about Android’s notification management system because I genuinely want to understand how I may be missing out and what to want Apple to do with iOS, but aside from the status bar, I really don’t see it.

An LCD doesn’t have any burn-in concerns to speak of. The only thing it would impact is battery use, because it doesn’t have per-pixel power draw.

IOS,twowheels,11965,"I find Google maps to be better for searching, especially for restaurants and obscure places like hiking trailheads, but Apple Maps is WAY better for actually driving there.  The spoken instructions are much more natural (less cognitive overhead), they only show stop signs that actually affect you (not every single one on the parallel bike trail), and the ui looks nicer. The wrist taps if you have the watch and next turn integration in dynamic island are the icing that make it even better.

IOS,Randomhuman114,1,"None of that requires an overhaul. Those are features that could easily be added with iOS’ current design language, and none of those limitations have anything to do with the way iOS is designed. 

Multitasking: very impractical in small displays. Apple hasn’t added it as an INTENTIONAL choice (obvious when you look at the iPad. They could easily import the multitasking system from that)

Keyboard: just install a third party if you need, I suppose, a numbers row or so. Apple has INTENTIONALLY kept the keyboard slimmed down and simple.

Home screen: genuinely can’t see what’s wrong with the current one.

Search functions: what are you on? Spotlight is lightyears ahead of any search system in any OS.

Camera features: once again, intentional choice to keep it simple for the average user.

RCS capabilities: business choice to keep their users trapped into their ecosystem.

I do agree that Siri is terribly outdated and needs major improvements, but rumors suggest Apple has been working on that since 2017 at the least. You mentioned a bunch of features that are either not bad whatsoever, or Apple has intentionally kept out of the OS for UX/business reasons. You didn’t prove iOS needs an overhaul or is “outdated”

IOS,Additional-Log4501,1,"Yea it is a beautiful phone but it is not a substantial upgrade even when I consider the promotion display and better battery than the Xs. The price is not worth the upgrade from a Xs. It just shows that Xs was a really good phone only let down by inferior battery. I was expecting a better performance change but the experience has been on par with my old XSmax in day to day usage. There is a dark screen every time I want to take a picture in a 3rd party app such as instagram, it was instantaneous on Xs max and also on my secondary oneplus 10pro. I would have expected apple/insta to fix it by now but the camera lag is still there after 10 months of owning the device. No USB C, not faster charging, battery performance is not the best in comparison to outgoing 13 but way better than Xs max. The only significant change I saw was in screen(bright, larger and faster) because even cameras are pretty comparable for normal usage unless you use proRAW or ProRES which takes a lot of storage. But yea it has that dynamic island, pretty useless so far other than when I want to pause music. No 3rd party integration so far.

IOS,SirMaster,2237,"Lol I know exactly how OLEDs works and how burn-in works...

My QD-OLED shifts the whole screen every few minutes.  But it only shifts it by a few pixels.

So sure it will avoid burn-in for small 1-3 pixel wide things, but large static elements will and still do burn-in.  Just the edges of it are more blurred instead of a hard burned in edge.  How is that going to stop a ~100x100 pixel element from burning in by shifting only a few pixels?
